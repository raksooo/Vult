2
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:41,343
Zero, this is Zero One Alpha.
We have secured Falcon.

3
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,976
I say again, We have secured Falcon.

4
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:48,952
I will count from one to ten. Within
that you'll tell me what I wanna know.

5
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,252
Otherwise...

6
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:54,552
the number ten is the
last thing you'll hear.

7
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:55,852
One,

8
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,191
two,

9
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:57,791

four,

11
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,725
five,

12
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:01,892
six,

13
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:03,002
seven,

14
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,319
eight...

15
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:05,352
Grenade. Get Back.

16
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,976
Allahu Akbar.

17
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:21,254
Shit.

18
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,354
Fucking missed it

19
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:25,454
How did I fucking miss it...

20
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:31,652
Merlin, I apologize for
putting you in this position.

21
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,552
You trained him well.

22
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:36,652
James,

23
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,525
your training is over.

24
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,850
Welcome to Kingsman,

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Lancelot.

26
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:47,403
Sir

27
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,652
I'll deal with this mess.

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Personally.

29
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,896
London

30
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:02,152
I very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.

31
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:03,207
I hope you understand.

32
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:04,334
How can I understand?

33
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,375
You won't tell me anything!

34
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,298
I didn't even know he
wasn't with his squad.

35
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,579
I'm so sorry, I can't say more.

36
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:16,652
I would like to present you
with this medal of valor.

37
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:20,052
If you look closely on the
back, there's a number.

38
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:22,952
And as a more concrete
gesture of our gratitude,

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,149
we'd like to offer you a...

40
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,626
Let's call it a favor.

41
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,990
The nature of it is your choice.

42
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:32,883
Just tell the operator:
"Oxford's, not Brogue's".

43
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,695
And then I'll know it's you.

44
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:37,752
I don't want your help.

45
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,852
I want my husband back.

46
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,041
What's your name, young man?

47
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,465
Eggsy.

48
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,952
Hello, Eggsy.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Can I see that?

50
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,252
You take care of this, Eggsy.

51
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,096
All right?

52
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:12,252
And take care of your mom too.

Argentina, 17 Years Later

55
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:56,610
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

56
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,299
Oh for god's sakes, just strip it off.

57
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:03,090
I am under very strict
instructions not to hurt you.

58
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,444
Look, you've made a mistake.

59
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:08,352
I am university lecturer.
I've got no money.

60
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:10,052
This isn't about money.

61
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,745
Our boss just wants to just talk to you.

62
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:14,427
Am I meant to find that reassuring?

63
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,700
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

64
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,352
Do you like whiskey?

65
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:22,373
Red, get a '62 Dalmore.

66
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:23,851
Hhmm...

67
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:26,974
Honestly, this whiskey is amazing.

68
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,235
You will shit.

69
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,302
I suppose asking to borrow a cup
of sugar is a step too far?

70
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:16,952
Professor Arnold,

71
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,028
I'm here to take you home.

72
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,585
Hmm... 1962 Dalmore.

73
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:33,684
It would be a sin to spill any.

74
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:36,143
Don't you think?

75
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,448
Can you hold these?

76
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Please.

77
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:33,536
Thank you.

78
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,094
Everything is clean.

79
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:50,552
My kind of welcome.

80
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:00,452
No stomach for violence.

81
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,141
I mean, literally.

82
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,752
I see one drop of blood, that is me..

83
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,705
Done.

84
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,152
I am like...

85
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,173
projectile.

86
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:10,052
Listen, I'm so sorry...

87
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,525
you had to witness all this unpleasantness.

88
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:15,252
Due to our uninvited guest.

89
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,595
But I promise you,

90
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:19,651
By the time I find out who he works for...

91
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:24,352
you and I will be the best of friends.

92
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,585
To the shop, please.

93
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,852
Arthur is in the dining room, sir.

94
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,852
Arthur.

Galahad.

96
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:15,019
The others were beginning to wonder if
we were going to have a double toast.

97
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:21,068
Gentlemen, I am thankful to say
that it's been 17 years...

98
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:24,552
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

99
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:29,452
Lancelot was an outstanding
agent and a true Kingsman.

100
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,152
He will be sorely missed.

101
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,100
To Lancelot.

102
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,964
<b>To Lancelot</b>

103
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:44,752
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

104
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,438
I want each of you to propose a candidate

105
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,341
and have them report to UK HQ

106
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:53,252
No later than 9 p.m. GMT.

107
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Thank you.

108
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,532
Merlin.

109
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,732
Come in.

110
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:03,279
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries

111
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,976
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

112
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,527
Glasses, gentlemen. Please.

113
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:13,852
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic Cathinone.

114
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:16,852
You put it in the water supply
of a guerrilla army base.

115
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:20,952
Rage, cannibalism. Multiple fatalities.

116
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:24,152
Chechnya, 2013.

117
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:25,819
Insurgents turned on one another.

118
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:29,652
Indisputable, the work of our mercenaries
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

119
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,040
So what happened to Lancelot?

120
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,737
He tracked them to this
property in Argentina.

121
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,089
And while he had them under surveillance,

122
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,352
he became aware that they
had effected a kidnapping.

123
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:43,091
So he executed a solo rescue mission...
which failed.

124
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:47,344
This is his last transmission:
<i><b>KIDNAP VICTIM IS PROFESSOR JAMES ARNOLD</b></i>

125
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,185
- Who is he?
- Some climate change doomsayer.

126
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:53,852
Expounded something called Gaia theory about
the world healing itself or some such.

127
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:57,452
But what's curious, is
he's not actually missing.

128
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,652
This is Professor Arnold.

129
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,752
At Imperial College, this morning.

130
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:08,052
It's all yours. And don't forget
your membership proposal.

131
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,452
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time.

132
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:12,912
17 years

133
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,655
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

134
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:20,482
Need i remind you, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man.

135
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,472
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them.

136
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:24,590
More so.

137
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:27,652
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

138
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:32,352
Let's face it, Galahad.
Your little experiment failed.

139
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:36,269
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

140
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,963
With respect?

141
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,654
The world is changing.

142
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:44,808
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

143
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:04,852
<b><i>Eggsy?</i></b>

144
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,033
<i>Eggsy, come here.</i>

145
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,352
- Got any whistler, babe?
- No.

146
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:16,721
Why don't you do your mamma a favor,
Go down to the shop and get some.

147
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:20,440
- Get 'em yourself.
- Oi, What i have said to you about speaking to Dean like that?

148
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:23,811
Three's a crowd, isn't it
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

149
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,362
I tell you what,

150
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,986
Why don't you take this and get the stuff
and get yourself some sweets?

151
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,431
And while you're gone, we'll show your
mother how three can be good a company.

152
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:37,341
Thanks babe.

153
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:40,471
Come here.

154
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,353
Here we go.

155
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,152
Is it better?

156
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:06,724
If Dean treat your mum's so
bad, why doesn't she leave him?

157
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,709
Low self-esteem.

158
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:08,917
That's her problem.

159
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,518
Fuck off, why would she
have low self-esteem?

160
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,080
Eggsy mum's a world fit.

161
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,002
- No offense pal.
- It's all right.

162
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,787
- One of these days I'm gonna smash his face in.
- Are you mental, cuz?

163
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:23,035
He'll just get that lot to do you
and then pretend he knew nothing

164
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,925
about it.

165
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,968
Oy, you think you can chat
shit about us and we wont do nothing,

166
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,376
just because our <i>governor
</i> bangin' Eggsy's mum?

167
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,330
Pretty much, yeah.

168
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:36,346
Leave it, let's just go, man.
It's not worth it.

169
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:39,552
You boys have outstayed your welcome.

170
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,650
Leave.

171
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:43,723
What?

172
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,904
I'm sorry about that <i>bruh</i>.

173
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,418
Yeah... muck.

174
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:54,735
They weren't fucking worth it, Boys.

175
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:59,361
It's freezing.
Why are we walking?

176
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,031
- You jacked his fucking car keys, <i>bruh</i>?
- Yeah, now we're gonna nick his car.

177
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:06,055
Fucking shit.

178
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,647
Hold on boys.

179
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:18,036
Hey, That's my fucking car.

180
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
Oi, Oi, Eggsy.

181
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,735
I swear,
you're in fucking trouble.

182
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,777
Floor it, Eggsy.

183
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,495
Hey yeah Dean, look it's me.

184
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:44,596
Eggsy just stole my fucking car.

185
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:49,082
I've come out of the pub, He's done 15 about
donuts on my fucking face and then he's drove off.

186
00:14:49,352 --> 00:14:54,372
No, I cant, He's disrespecting me
and so he's disrespecting you.

187
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,966
<i>Thickie.</i>

188
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:44,352
Foxes are vermin, cuz.
You should've driven it over.

189
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,451
I should've done a lot of things.

190
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,551
I'll sort this, get out of the car.

191
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,651
Get out of the fucking car.

192
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:03,052
Eggsy, there is no such thing
as honor among thieves.

193
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:07,852
Now you can start giving me some
names of the boys you were with...

194
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,769
Or you go down.

195
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,735
It's up to you.

196
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,885
I want to exercise my
right to a phone call.

197
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:20,452
Well, I hope it's to your mom...

198
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:24,684
to tell her that you're gonna to be
18 months late for your dinner.

199
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:58,077
<i>Customer complaints.
How may I help you?</i>

200
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:02,952
My name's Eggsy Unwin. Sorry, Gary Unwin.

201
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:06,509
And I'm up shit creek, I'm in
an urban police station and

202
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,199
my mom said to call this number
if ever I needed help...

203
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,751
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.</i>

204
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,409
Wait, wait

205
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:16,326
Oxford's not Brogue's?

206
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,589
<i>Your complaint has been duly noted,</i>

207
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,388
<i>and we hope that we've not lost you
as a loyal customer.</i>

208
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:34,654
Yeah...

209
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:37,652
Shit, What?

210
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:44,652
Yes, I totally understand.

211
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:05,977
Eggsy

212
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,163
Would you like a lift home?

213
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:09,618
Who are you?

214
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:11,552
The man who got you released.

215
00:18:11,618 --> 00:18:12,618
That ain't an answer.

216
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:15,152
A little gratitude would be nice.

217
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,996
My name is Harry Hart.

218
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,245
And I gave you that medal.

219
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,352
Your father saved my life.

220
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,052
So before you was a tailor, were
you in the army?

221
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,775
Like an officer?

222
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,237
Not quite.

223
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,325
So where was you posted, Iraq or something?

224
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:36,552
Sorry, Eggsy. Classified.

225
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,452
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

226
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,352
The day your father died,

227
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:43,973
I missed something.

228
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:46,709
And if it weren't for
his courage, my mistake

229
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,776
would have cost the lives
of every man present.

230
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:51,809
So I owe him.

231
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:56,152
Your father was a brave man.

232
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:57,295
A good man.

233
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:01,452
And having read your files, I'd think he'd be
bitterly disappointed in the choices you've made.

234
00:19:01,553 --> 00:19:03,073
You can't talk to me like that.

235
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,367
Huge IQ, great performance
in primary school.

236
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,088
And it all went tits up.

237
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,300
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

238
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:12,777
Do you think there's a lot
of jobs going around here?

239
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,428
Doesn't explain why you
gave up your hobbies.

240
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,580
First prize, regional
under tens' gymnastics

241
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,252
Two years in a row. Your coach had you
pegged as Olympic team material.

242
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:22,934
Yeah and when you grow up
around someone like my

243
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,476
step-dad, you pick up new
hobbies pretty quick.

244
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:27,252
Ah of course, always someone else's fault.

245
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,874
And who's to blame you for
quitting the Marines?

246
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:32,576
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

247
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,552
Because my mum went mental.

248
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,200
Banging on about losing
me as well as my dad.

249
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:40,178
Then we wouldn't be cannon
fodder for snobs like

250
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,776
you, judging people like
me from your ivory towers.

251
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:45,679
With no thought about why we do what we do.

252
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,606
We ain't got much choice, you get me?

253
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,214
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses...

254
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,336
we would do just as well as you,

255
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:54,836
if not better.

256
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,954
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking a piss?

257
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:01,752
Some more examples of young men who
simply need a silver suppository?

258
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,851
Ya, they are exceptions. Come on.

259
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:05,188
Nonsense, we haven't finished our drinks.

260
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,263
After you nicked his
car, Dean says you're a

261
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,476
fair guy I don't give a
shit what your mum says.

262
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:11,252
Listen, boys.

263
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:16,290
I've had a rather emotional day,
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,

264
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,743
and I'm sure it's well founded...

265
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:22,374
I would appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace...

266
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:25,364
until I finish this
lovely pint of Guinness.

267
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,352
You should get out of the way, Granddaddy.
Or you'll get hurt a lot.

268
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:33,452
He ain't joking, you should go.

269
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:40,775
Excuse me.

270
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:45,743
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith's Street.

271
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,563
Manners...

272
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,011
maketh...

273
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,230
man.

274
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:08,867
Do you know what that means?

275
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,452
Then let me teach you a lesson.

276
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:25,152
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

277
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,927
You fucking... You fucking...

278
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:16,362
"STUN"

279
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,535
Amnesia

280
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:54,994
Sorry about that.

281
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,603
Needed to let off a little steam.

282
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:00,702
Heard, yesterday a friend of mine died.

283
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:03,752
He knew your father too, actually.

284
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:10,452
I do apologise, Eggsy. I should not
have done this in front of you.

285
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:13,039
No. Please.. I won't say nothing,
I swear.

286
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,866
If there is one thing I can
do, it's keep my mouth shut.

287
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:17,319
- You won't tell a soul?
- I swear, I've never crossed anyone out.

288
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,352
Is that a promise?
- On my life.

289
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,452
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

290
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:27,752
You're right about the snobs.

291
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:30,413
But there too, there are exceptions.

292
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:32,252
Best of luck with everything.

293
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:50,952
<i>In celebrity news, The Richmond Valentine

because he's gonna...

299
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,232
- Please don't hurt him.
- Fuck off!

300
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,633
Shut the fuck up.

301

Who was with you in that fucking pub?

302

- I want to know the name of the geezer you was with.
- I was not with anyone.

303
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,847
I don't know what you're on about.

Fuck off.

00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:18,914
Come here.

322
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:33,053
You wanker!

323
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I'll have you soon.

324
00:26:00,252 --> 00:26:02,452
I've never met a tailor before.

325
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:05,060
But I know you ain't one.

326
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:09,982
Come with me.

327
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,824
Come on here.

328
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:27,014
What do you see?

329
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:30,167
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

330
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,052
I see a young man with potential.

331
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,152
A young man who is loyal.

332
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:40,549
Who can do as he is asked,

333
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,703
and who wants to do something
good with his life.

334
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:46,552
Did you see the film "Trading Places"?

335
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:48,576
No

336
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,952
How about "Nikita"?

337
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,111
"Pretty Woman"?

338
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:55,302
All right.

339
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:57,850
My point is, the lack of a
silver spoon has set you

340
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,176
on a certain path, but
you needn't stay on it.

341
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:05,429
If you're prepare to adapt and learn,
you can transform.

342
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:08,052
Oh, like in "My Fair Lady"?

343
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:11,852
I know you're full of surprises.

344
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:13,752
Yes, like "My Fair Lady"

345
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:18,452
Only in this case, I am offering you the
opportunity to become a Kingsman.

346
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,352
A tailor?

347
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:22,856
A Kingsman agent.

348
00:27:23,652 --> 00:27:26,352
- Like a spy?
- Of sorts.

349
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:29,804
Interested?

350
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:32,390
You think I've got anything to lose?

351
00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:44,952
Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

352
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:49,452
In 1919, a great number of them had lost
their heirs to World War 1.

353
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,552
That meant a lot of money
going un-inherited.

354
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:58,152
And a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

355
00:27:58,252 --> 00:28:00,702
Our founders realized
that they could channel

356
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,176
that wealth and influence
for a greater good.

357
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:07,152
And so began our adventure.

358
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,310
An independent international
intelligence agency

359
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:13,205
operating at the highest
level of discretion.

360
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:15,729
Without the politics and bureaucracy...

361
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,750
that undermine the integrity of
government run spy organizations.

362
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,274
A suit is the modern gentleman's armor.

363
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:26,652
And the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

364
00:28:27,852 --> 00:28:30,552
- How deep does this fucking thing go?
- Deep enough.

365
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,752
Shit. We're late.

366
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:44,152
Your father had the same look on his face.

367
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:47,008
As did I.

368
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:49,989
Come on.

369
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:54,852
- Galahad.
- My code name.

370
00:29:54,952 --> 00:29:57,252
Late again, sir.

371
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,378
Good Luck.

372
00:29:58,552 --> 00:30:00,091
In you go.

373
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:12,670
Fall in.

374
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,847
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

375
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:20,478
You are about to embark
on what is probably the

376
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,676
most dangerous job
interview in the world.

377
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:27,752
One of you and only one of you
will become the next Lancelot.

378
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,952
Can anybody tell me what this is?

379
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:35,465
- A body bag, sir.
- Correct.

380
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:38,452
- Charlie, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:41,151
In a moment, you will
each collect a body bag.

382
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:43,276
You will write your
name on that bag.

383
00:30:43,352 --> 00:30:46,652
You will write the details of your
next of kin. On that bag.

384
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:48,502
This represents your
acknowledgment of

385
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,276
the risks that you
are about to face...

386
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:52,438
as well as your
agreement to strict

387
00:30:52,463 --> 00:30:55,476
confidentiality, which
incidentally if you break...

388
00:30:55,552 --> 00:31:01,252
will result in you and your next
of kin being in that bag.

389
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:04,452
Is that understood?

390
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:07,352
Excellent.

391
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,876
Fall out.

392
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:17,583
Roxanne. But..

393
00:31:17,608 --> 00:31:19,276
Call me Roxy.

394
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:20,791
- I am Eggsy.
- Eggy?

395
00:31:20,816 --> 00:31:21,876
No, Eggsy

396
00:31:23,352 --> 00:31:24,856
Eggy... and where did
they dig you up?

397
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,176
You know we are not allowed
to discuss who proposed us.

398
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,682
No need to bite his head off.

399
00:31:28,707 --> 00:31:30,976
Charlie's only making
conversation, right Charlie?

400
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,052
I'm Digby.

401
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:34,727
Digby.

402
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:36,025
Eggy, this is

403
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,668
Rufus.

404
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:38,032
Rufus, Eggy.

405
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:43,178
So Eggy, are you
Oxford or Cambridge?

406
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,203
Neither.

407
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:45,480
St. Andrews? Durham?

408
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,776
Oh wait, I think we may have met.

409
00:31:47,853 --> 00:31:51,475
Did you serve me at the McDonalds
in Winchester Service Station?

410
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:52,715
No.

411
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:55,454
But if I had, I give you an
extra helping of secret sauce.

412
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:57,399
It's definitely St. Andrews.

413
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,351
- Just ignore them.
- Do you need a pen?

414
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,077
Cheers.

415
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:03,976
- Amelia, isn't it?

416
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
- Amelia,
- Eggsy

417
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,251
Hi Eggsy!

418
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:09,308
Don't take any notice
of those guys.

419
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,776
That's what I told him.

420
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:14,552
It's just scare tactics.

421
00:32:14,652 --> 00:32:16,364
Classic army technique.

422
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:17,876
No one's gonna die.

423
00:32:21,552 --> 00:32:22,791
Shame.

424
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:27,878
Great, so you don't know,
the CIA don't know.

425
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:29,876
Nobody knows who this guy is?

426
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,227
Fine.

427
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:33,276
Seriously, it's fine.

428
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,296
Well, it's not really fine but

429
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,876
it's not why I'm here.

430
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:38,948
Hell man, you know me?

431
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:40,641
Money's not my issue.

432
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:43,194
I could have retired straight
out of MIT, fucked off

433
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,435
to some island and let
the business run itself.

434
00:32:45,552 --> 00:32:48,702
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet.

435
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:49,776
I wanted to.

436
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:53,952
Climate change research, lobbying,
years of studying, billions of dollars.

437
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,185
And you know why i quit?

438
00:32:56,285 --> 00:33:01,063
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

439
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:03,828
Hence, my epiphany.

440
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:06,852
Money won't solve this.

441
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,297
Those idiots who call
themselves politicians,

442
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,176
they bury their heads
in the sand...

443
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:13,907
and stood for nothing but re-election.

444
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:18,752
So I spent the last two years trying
to find a real solution.

445
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:21,269
And I found it.

446
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:25,643
Now, If you really want to make
the world a better place...

447
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,980
I suggest you open
your fucking ears

448
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,241
because I'm about
to tell it to you.

449
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,364
Go on, Mr. Valentine.

450
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:34,199
I'm still listening.

451
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:38,453
As long as you agree to all my terms.

452
00:34:27,352 --> 00:34:30,352
No one panic. Listen to me. Stay calm.

453
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:36,651
- Use snorkels.
- Use snorkels?

454
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:39,704
- Shower heads.
- Shower heads?

455
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,804
She's right. Go. Fucking go.

456
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:45,173
And what about pulling the fucking door?

457
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:10,278
Congratulations

458
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,276
on completing your first task.

459
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:14,852
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

460
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:17,152
For those who 're still confused

461
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:19,399
If you get a breathing
tube run the U-bend of

462
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,476
a toilet, you have an
unlimited air supply.

463
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:23,952
Simple physics. Worth remembering.

464
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:24,883
Eggsy,

465
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:27,400
Well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

466
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,744
He is probably seen enough of 'em.

467
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,676
Yeah you can all wipe those
smirks off your faces.

468
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,179
Because as far as
I am concerned,

469
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:34,737
every single one
of you has failed.

470
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,152
You all forgot the most important thing:

471
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,252
Teamwork.

472
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:58,457
So much for classic army technique.

473
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,465
35,

474
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,677
5.

475
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,452
That's it.

476
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:13,447
Hello?

477
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:14,902
Can I help you?

478
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:18,676
Yes, I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

479
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:22,792
Really? Well, it's actually
quite fascinating.

480
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:26,347
My colleague died
trying to rescue you.

481
00:37:26,372 --> 00:37:28,320
And I'm sure you saw how
well-trained he was.

482
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:31,252
So I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go.

483
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,373
I have no idea what you're talking about...

484
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:35,757
I can not say, it was...

485
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:39,252
Oh for god's sake, I barely touched you.
How man are...

486
00:37:58,452 --> 00:37:59,933
<font color="#ff0000">"IMPLANT ACTIVATED"

487
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:02,934
Fuck that guy, whoever he is, I'm gonna...

488
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:06,009
He made me kill
Professor Arnold.

489
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,868
Goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

490
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,764
Well the good news is

491
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,876
we know the emergency and
surveillance systems work.

492
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:12,992
You know what is not good news?

493
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:14,666
"My colleague died."

494
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:16,422
That's what he said.

495
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:18,949
This is an organization
and they are all over us.

496
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:20,128
Whoever you spoke to...

497
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:24,852
I told you, I am in contact with the
KGB, MI6, Mossad and Beijing.

498
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,052
They all insist he
wasn't one of theirs.

499
00:38:27,077 --> 00:38:28,077
Beijing.

500
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,552
So freaky how there's no recognizable name
for the Chinese Secret Service.

501
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:35,552
Now that's what you call a secret, right?

502
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,090
You know what?

503
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:41,551
Fuck it. We need to speed things up.
Bring the product release forward.

504
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,252
They are only halfway into production.
Speeding it will cost a fortune.

505
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:48,450
Do I look like I give a fuck?
Just get it done..

506
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:54,112
As some of you will have
learned last night:

507
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,152
Teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

508
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:01,658
We are here to enhance your skills,
test you to limits.

509
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:05,652
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

510
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,948
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

511
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,405
You will care for it,
you will teach it.

512
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:13,552
And by the time they are fully trained,
so will you be.

513
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,252
Those of you who are still here, that is.

514
00:39:16,352 --> 00:39:18,199
Do you understand?

515
00:39:18,224 --> 00:39:20,276
Choose your puppy.

516
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:24,052
A poodle?

517
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:24,884
What?

518
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:27,100
They are gun dogs.

519
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,019
Oldest working breed.

520
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:30,376
Easy to train.

521
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:33,390
A pug?

522
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:36,445
It's a bulldog, isn't it?

523
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,473
It would get bigger though, wouldn't it?

524
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,651
Ssshhhit

525
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,852
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

526
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:54,252
No direct brain trauma at all.

527
00:39:54,552 --> 00:39:56,161
How much longer can he be out?

528
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,276
That's the million-dollar question.

529
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,488
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.

530
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:01,876
What about Harry's footage?

531
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:03,701
It didn't stream to
his home terminal?

532
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,799
Encrypted and uncrackable.

533
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:09,012
If and when he comes round,
you might wanna have

534
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:10,976
a word with him about
sharing his password.

535
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:12,552
Is he gonna be alright?

536
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:16,199
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

537
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:17,676
But there is hope. Okay?

538
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:20,175
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.

539
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,276
Make it through the
test, make him proud.

540
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:32,852
Come on, J. B. Come on.

541
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:38,538
I am not coming last cause of you.

542
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,855
J. B, I'll shoot you, goddamn.
I'll fucking shoot you.

543
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,752
Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you.

544
00:40:46,684 --> 00:40:47,956
Bollocks.

545
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:32,330
Water.

546
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,008
Come on then.

547
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:36,856
Eggsy, you forget it.

548
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:38,521
Oh what's wrong mate,
can't take a joke?

549
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:40,477
Seriously, you'll get turned out and it's
just not worth it.

550
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:42,523
Maybe I don't give a fuck
about getting kicked out.

551
00:41:42,548 --> 00:41:43,748
Really? Come on, you player.

552
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:45,783
Charlie, fuck off.

553
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,473
Yeah, go on, walk away.

554
00:41:49,498 --> 00:41:50,498
Dickhead.

555
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:53,012
Come on, J. B.

556
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:54,476
It's all right.

557
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:10,539
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test.

558
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,578
Starting now.

559
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:17,752
<i>- New target. 800 meters.
- It's unbelievable. You're still here.</i>

560
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:21,165
Lingering on like some big steaming shit
that just won't flush.

561
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:22,361
Roger that.

562
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:25,463
Target identified. And how
about you shut the fuck up.

563
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:26,579
Positive discrimination.

564
00:42:26,768 --> 00:42:27,827
It's worth it.

565
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,795
Like those fucking steak
cooks who go down seaways

566
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,087
because their mum's a
one-legged lesbian.

567
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:35,030
You don't know fuck-all about my grades.

568
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:37,288
Oh forgive me. I'm sure
you're highly educated.

569
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,313
Fire when ready.

570
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:42,952
How's that for positive discrimination?

571
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,852
I wanna thank you both for listening.

572
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,239
And I really, really appreciate
your traveling all this way,

573
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:01,376
Your Royal Highness.

574
00:43:01,452 --> 00:43:03,508
And you too, Prime Minister.

575
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:06,176
I think this is quite brilliant.

576
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:09,352
It is absolutely brilliant.

577
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:13,652
You are completely crazy.

578
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:26,947
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness...

579
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:28,897
but you got a big role to play...

580
00:43:28,998 --> 00:43:31,252
in getting the Scandinavian
region back on track.

581
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:33,096
You're popular,
inspirational and

582
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:35,376
you have the power to
galvanize the people.

583
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:38,352
Now whether you're on board or not...

584
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:40,202
I am going to have to insist

585
00:43:40,227 --> 00:43:43,476
on getting you somewhere I
can ensure your safety.

586
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:45,685
How about you, Prime Minister?

587
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,776
You in or out?

588
00:43:46,852 --> 00:43:48,852
Well, I think it's
about time that

589
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,876
a politician did
something that...

590
00:43:51,452 --> 00:43:53,950
actually made a difference.

591
00:43:53,975 --> 00:43:55,177
Too true.

592
00:43:56,352 --> 00:43:57,952
Take her away.

593
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:02,519
Drink?

594
00:44:02,544 --> 00:44:04,676
Why not?

595
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:09,052
Wait, help me.

596
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:11,852
Do not worry. No harm will
come to the princess.

597
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:16,452
Well I'm Republican anyway,
so it really doesn't matter.

598
00:44:17,652 --> 00:44:18,852
Release the princess.

599
00:44:52,352 --> 00:44:53,631
Okay, you're done.

600
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:55,076
Not too bad, right?

601
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:57,630
I hardly felt a thing.

602
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,276
Welcome aboard.

603
00:44:59,752 --> 00:45:01,880
The pleasure is all mine.

604
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,558
Ever heard of knocking?

605
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:12,376
Only when I'm casing
a place to rob.

606
00:45:13,052 --> 00:45:14,752
Amelia said you wanted to see me.

607
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:17,752
Hope J. B.'s training is going
as well as yours is.

608
00:45:17,852 --> 00:45:18,986
Sit.

609
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:24,252
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

610
00:45:24,352 --> 00:45:27,052
Your test results are even
better than I could've hoped.

611
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:30,639
Come in.

612
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,528
Eggsy, I need to have a
private conversation.

613
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:38,593
You're dismissed.

614
00:45:38,844 --> 00:45:43,119
Nonsense, let him observe.
He'd learn a thing or two.

615
00:45:43,252 --> 00:45:45,752
As you wish. Take a look at this.

616
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:52,603
Fucking hell. That's his... harry.

617
00:45:53,452 --> 00:45:54,799
You blew up his head?

618
00:45:54,824 --> 00:45:56,476
Its a bit much, isn't it?

619
00:45:56,552 --> 00:46:00,252
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

620
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:01,549
Here. Under that scar.

621
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:04,676
Did my hardware pick up the
signal that triggered it?

622
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:06,652
Fortunately, yes.

623
00:46:06,752 --> 00:46:08,170
Unfortunately, the IP address

624
00:46:08,195 --> 00:46:11,176
it traced it to is registered
to the Valentine Corporation.

625
00:46:11,252 --> 00:46:14,152
It's not much of a lead.
They have millions of employees worldwide.

626
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,852
No, Richmond Valentine is a genius.

627
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,503
Did you not see his announcement today?

628
00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:24,069
No.

629
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,052
<i>We each spend on average</i>

630
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:33,876
<i>$2,000 a year on cellphone
and internet usage.</i>

631
00:46:33,952 --> 00:46:37,755
It gives me great
pleasure to announce,

632
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,776
those days are over.

633
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:45,052
As of tomorrow, every man, woman and child
can claim a free SIM card...

634
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:49,452
compatible with any cellphone,
any computer and...

635
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:53,652
<i>utilize my communications network
for free.</i>

636
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:58,252
<i>Free calls. Free internet. For everyone.</i>

637
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:00,684
<i>Forever.</i>

638
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:19,193
Valentine's assistant has
the same implant scar.

639
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:22,652
I think Mr. Valentine and I
shall have a tête-à-tête.

640
00:47:25,852 --> 00:47:28,452
He's having a gala dinner next week.

641
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:29,833
I'll get you an invitation.

642
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:31,376
You need to be careful though.

643
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:33,612
Since you were out, hundreds of VIPs
have gone missing.

644
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:36,179
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

645
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:38,514
Then I suggest you make my alias

646
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:40,343
somebody worth kidnapping.

647
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:55,761
You don’t like heights?

648
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:57,776
Yes it's okay I've done it before.

649
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:00,352
Probably alright if I don't think of it.

650
00:48:02,352 --> 00:48:05,352
Hey, you'll be alright,
You're top of the class.

651
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:11,252
<i>Listen up, your mission is to land in the
target without the radar detecting you.</i>

652
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:15,366
If I read you on the radar or
you miss the target, you go home.

653
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:17,052
Is that understood?

654
00:48:20,152 --> 00:48:22,652
<i>Drop zone coming up. 20 seconds.</i>

655
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:25,252
Here we go.

656
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:37,862
- I really don't think I can do this.
- Of course you can't.

657
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:39,852
Get to the back and I'll
show you how, yeah.

658
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:49,843
Eggsy, Eggsy.. wait. Hang on.

659
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:52,321
Roxy, just stop fucking about.

660
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:55,352
Follow me, yeah?

661
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:14,152
<i>Roxy, it's now or never.</i>

662
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,400
Jump.

663
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:37,932
Good girl, Rox.
I'm glad you made it.

664
00:49:56,752 --> 00:49:58,388
My my, you're all very cheerful.

665
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,276
You really think it was gonna
be that straightforward?

666
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:03,752
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

667
00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:05,602
A Kingsman agent
needs to be able

668
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,376
to solve problems
under pressure.

669
00:50:08,152 --> 00:50:12,152
Like what to do when one of your group
has no parachute.

670
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:15,952
No parachute? Who?

671
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,822
Fuck. Which one?

672
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,603
What do we do?

673
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:22,952
I told you. Aim for the target
coming under the radar.

674
00:50:23,052 --> 00:50:25,595
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.

675
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,557
But if I do have to and
you're inside the target...

676
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:30,750
means I'll be very impressed.

677
00:50:36,352 --> 00:50:38,352
<i>Everybody listen, I've got a plan.</i>

678
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,638
<i>Pair up. Grab the closest person to you.</i>

679
00:50:45,252 --> 00:50:46,752
<i>Rufus, come on.</i>

680
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:47,775
Oh fuck.

681
00:50:48,656 --> 00:50:49,476
<i>Rufus!</i>

682
00:50:49,584 --> 00:50:50,900
<i>Oh shit! I can't</i>

683
00:50:55,108 --> 00:50:56,108
<i>Fuck!!!</i>

684
00:50:57,218 --> 00:50:57,952
<i>Fucking cock.</i>

685
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,020
<i>Rufus, you wanker.</i>

686
00:51:01,447 --> 00:51:03,145
<i>We are an odd number now.</i>

687
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,971
<i>- Quick, make a circle.
- Fuck. Right boys. Let's do it.</i>

688
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,599
<i>We'll pull our cords one by one.</i>

689
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,862
<i>When we know who's it, the person
on the right grabs him.</i>

690
00:51:17,886 --> 00:51:19,886
<i>Ok, Eggsy</i>

691
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:23,252
Good plan, Eggsy. You have 30 seconds.
Come on now. Hurry up.

692
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:25,252
<i>You first.</i>

693
00:51:25,276 --> 00:51:27,276
<i>Fuck</i>

694
00:51:30,852 --> 00:51:32,380
<i>OK, Me next.</i>

695
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:38,139
<i>See you on the ground, boys.</i>

696
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:42,032
<i>Now me.</i>

697
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,948
<i>Roxy, no matter what happens now,
I've got you. Alright?</i>

698
00:51:58,445 --> 00:51:59,045
<i>OK, Eggsy</i>

699
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,078
<i>You first, okay?</i>

700
00:52:00,103 --> 00:52:01,103
<i>Yep</i>

701
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:14,908
Shit.

702
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:23,424
Oh Shit.

703
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,021
<i>Rox</i>

704
00:52:50,152 --> 00:52:52,026
Hugo, Digby,

705
00:52:52,027 --> 00:52:55,376
You don't land in the K
then you're not in the K.

706
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:57,352
Rufus, you opened too soon.

707
00:52:57,377 --> 00:52:59,376
You were all over the radar.

708
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:01,452
All three of you, pack your bags. Go home.

709
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:05,489
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.

710
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:07,576
You have set a new record.

711
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,168
Opening at 300 feet,
that's pretty ballsy.

712
00:53:10,193 --> 00:53:12,776
Well done on completing another task.
Follow.

713
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:16,944
Sorry sir, but why the fuck
you choose me as the gimp?

714
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,466
- Am I the expendable candidate?
- No no no. You don't talk to me like that.

715
00:53:21,052 --> 00:53:24,202
If you have a complaint, you came here
and you whisper in my ear.

716
00:53:30,152 --> 00:53:32,819
You need to take that
jape off your shoulder.

717
00:54:04,052 --> 00:54:07,052
Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

718
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:09,786
I am sorry. I seem to
have my dates muddles up.

719
00:54:09,886 --> 00:54:12,852
Oh no no. I canceled the
gala because of you.

720
00:54:13,252 --> 00:54:15,502
Anybody willing to
donate that much

721
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:17,776
deserves their own dinner.
Come in.

722
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:20,033
Thank you.

723
00:54:21,752 --> 00:54:24,423
Gotta admit, I was really
intrigued to meet you.

724
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,586
There are not many
billionaires I do not know.

725
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:27,476
I don't doubt it.

726
00:54:27,552 --> 00:54:30,517
Obviously, I have had my people
looking into your affairs

727
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:32,893
and that's some pretty
old money you're from.

728
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,407
How'd your folks make it?

729
00:54:34,432 --> 00:54:37,076
Property, mostly.
Property in the markets.

730
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:39,852
Nothing personal, if that's your concern.

731
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:43,652
No, I'm just in to find out what kind of
person you are. I'm sure you understand that.

732
00:54:43,752 --> 00:54:44,682
I most certainly do.

733
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:45,776
Hope you're hungry.

734
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:46,966
I'm famished.

735
00:54:46,991 --> 00:54:48,876
Good. Grab a seat.

736
00:55:10,552 --> 00:55:12,128
I'll have the Big Mac, please.

737
00:55:12,153 --> 00:55:13,076
Great choice.

738
00:55:13,152 --> 00:55:16,552
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

739
00:55:16,653 --> 00:55:18,716
Tastes great with
this '45 Lafite.

740
00:55:18,741 --> 00:55:19,978
A classic pairing.

741
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:23,852
May I suggest Twinkies with
1937 Château d'Yquem for pudding?

742
00:55:23,952 --> 00:55:25,605
I like it

743
00:55:26,092 --> 00:55:29,452
So you want to donate to my foundation?

744
00:55:29,852 --> 00:55:33,052
You are aware that I wind
things down in that area, right?

745
00:55:33,412 --> 00:55:36,412
Climate changes affect us all,
Mr. Valentine.

746
00:55:36,552 --> 00:55:39,552
And you are one of the few powerful people
who seems to share my concerns.

747
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:42,626
I stepped things down because
I wasn't getting anywhere.

748
00:55:42,727 --> 00:55:45,452
Every bit of research kept
pointing to the same thing.

749
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:48,152
The carbon emissions are a red
herring, and we are past the

750
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:50,776
point of no return no matter
what remedial actions we take.

751
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:52,588
You know your shit.

752
00:55:52,778 --> 00:55:56,797
I sometimes envy the blissful
ignorance of those less well-versed

753
00:55:56,822 --> 00:55:58,161
in their shit.

754
00:55:59,352 --> 00:56:01,352
As Professor Arnold always said:

755
00:56:01,452 --> 00:56:04,396
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live with the

756
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:07,476
horrifying knowledge of its
host's fragile mortality."

757
00:56:08,552 --> 00:56:11,046
There are not a lot of
people who know about him.

758
00:56:13,752 --> 00:56:16,452
Do you like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

759
00:56:19,852 --> 00:56:22,552
Nowadays, they're all a little
serious for my taste.

760
00:56:23,152 --> 00:56:25,852
But the old ones... marvelous.

761
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:28,785
Give me a farfetched
theatrical plot any day.

762
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,176
The old Bond movies. Oh, man.

763
00:56:32,252 --> 00:56:35,952
Ah, When I was a kid,
that was my dream job.

764
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:38,452
A gentleman spy.

765
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:42,148
I always felt the old Bond films were
only as good as the villain.

766
00:56:42,423 --> 00:56:46,423
As a child, I rather fancied
a futuristic colorful megalomaniac.

767
00:56:48,252 --> 00:56:51,513
What a shame we both had to grow up.

768
00:56:56,148 --> 00:56:57,452
Bon appétit.

769
00:56:59,952 --> 00:57:03,052
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

770
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:06,552
I'll have my people get in touch with yours
and it's all good.

771
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:10,152
Thank you for such a "Happy Meal".

772
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:17,752
- Well, you want me to follow him?
- Nah.

773
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,552
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

774
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:26,252
We'll know his every move for the next 24
hours. Finally find out who he works for.

775
00:57:28,452 --> 00:57:30,660
Valentine didn't let
me out of his sight.

776
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:32,524
All I got was this,
on the way in.

777
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:40,752
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

778
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:42,936
The FBI have been
monitoring them for years.

779
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:44,676
Do you think Valentine
is a supporter?

780
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:48,105
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

781
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:49,877
Oh, by the way,

782
00:57:49,902 --> 00:57:52,676
the ever-growing list
of missing persons...

783
00:57:52,752 --> 00:57:55,785
Now includes Scandinavian Royalty.

784
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:58,652
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

785
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:03,652
Just let me out, you PSYCHO!

786
00:58:03,752 --> 00:58:06,752
I told you, you're free
to go anytime you want.

787
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:09,777
As long as you agree
to my conditions.

788
00:58:09,802 --> 00:58:11,076
I don't agree.

789
00:58:11,215 --> 00:58:14,144
And I am never ever going to agree!

790
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:15,651
Enough yet.

791
00:58:15,752 --> 00:58:17,314
Bitch.

792
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:25,652
<i>The list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks.</i>

793
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,752
<i>And world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers.</i>

794
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:33,052
We are doing everything in our
power to find princess Tilde.

795
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:38,052
You know, governments and security forces
worldwide are working together...

796
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,825
to find the person behind these abductions.

797
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:44,144
<i>In other news, people all
over the world continue to</i>

798
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:47,376
<i>wait in line day and night
to get their free SIM card.</i>

799
00:58:47,452 --> 00:58:50,152
Mrs. P. You get one?

800
00:58:50,252 --> 00:58:52,852
Yeah, I've been queuing up all day.

801
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:57,352
<i>This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine...</i>

802
00:58:57,452 --> 00:59:00,452
<i>has already seen over a
billion cards distributed.</i>

803
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:02,052
At ease.

804
00:59:03,652 --> 00:59:06,192
So you thought you were
done for the day, huh?

805
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:08,352
Probably not.

806
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:12,352
- A party?
- Tonight. In London.

807
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:15,152
- Who is this?
- Your target.

808
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,927
Your mission is to use your
NLP Training to win over

809
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:20,576
the individual in the
photograph in your envelope.

810
00:59:20,652 --> 00:59:24,152
And when I say "win over", I
do mean in the Biblical sense.

811
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:25,481
Easy

812
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:28,077
Most girls love a bit rough.

813
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:30,121
We'll see about that, yeah.

814
00:59:30,452 --> 00:59:32,152
Who is that anyway?

815
00:59:38,352 --> 00:59:42,052
I just had to come over
and say "Amazing eyes".

816
00:59:42,152 --> 00:59:44,652
- You wearing color contacts?
- No.

817
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:48,152
- You so are
- Oh my god. 'Negging'. That's hilarious.

818
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,652
I haven't had anyone try
that since the 90s.

819
00:59:50,677 --> 00:59:51,677
Excuse me?

820
00:59:51,852 --> 00:59:54,458
"Negging". Saying something
negative to a pretty

821
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:56,876
girl in order to undermine
her social value.

822
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,772
Its supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

823
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:02,676
Absurdly basic neurolinguistic
programming technique.

824
01:00:02,752 --> 01:00:04,935
Is it just me or does this
champagne taste a little bit funny?

825
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,240
That's an acquired taste, mate.

826
01:00:06,253 --> 01:00:08,852
- I think it's just cheap.
- Get one of these instead. They're delicious.

827
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:12,056
You know, if you're interested in ornamental
techniques, this guy is textbook.

828
01:00:12,157 --> 01:00:14,221
See what he just did? Its
called an 'opinion opener.

829
01:00:14,246 --> 01:00:16,076
He got you talking with
a neutral question...

830
01:00:16,152 --> 01:00:20,352
got all of us involved in the conversation,
so that you crave individual attention.

831
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:22,839
Nah, I'm just saying that the
champagne tastes weird...

832
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:25,676
Lady Sophie, Montague Herring,
phone call for you at reception.

833
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:28,752
- Be right back.
- See you in a bit, yeah.

834
01:00:29,152 --> 01:00:32,687
- Good job, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.
- You alright?

835
01:00:32,788 --> 01:00:34,084
Sorry to eavesdrop...

836
01:00:34,187 --> 01:00:37,647
but there is a much easier way to
guarantee getting someone home.

837
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:39,552
Rohypnol.

838
01:00:41,452 --> 01:00:43,652
Or even something stronger.

839
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,748
Who the fuck are you?

840
01:01:03,852 --> 01:01:05,352
Where am I?

841
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:10,572
This knife can save your life.

842
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,900
Fuck

843
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,892
My employer's got two
questions for you, Eggsy.

844
01:01:19,152 --> 01:01:23,200
What the fuck is Kingsman?
And who is Harry Hart?

845
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,942
I do not know what the fuck that is.

846
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:27,720
Oh Eggsy, I just killed
two of your friends

847
01:01:27,745 --> 01:01:29,810
because they gave me the
same bullshit answer.

848
01:01:32,018 --> 01:01:34,504
Just cut the fucking ropes, please.

849
01:01:34,812 --> 01:01:36,945
Eggsy, is the Kingsman worth dying for?

850
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,366
Fuck You

851
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:56,323
Congratulations.

852
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:57,776
Bloody well done.

853
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:03,444
- How'd the others do?
- Roxy passed with flying colors.

854
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,425
Charlie's up next.

855
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,676
Want to watch?

856
01:02:07,752 --> 01:02:09,252
Yeah, alright.

857
01:02:11,552 --> 01:02:13,752
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

858
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:17,212
No fuck, it isn't shit
I'll tell all you want, please.

859
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:18,831
Chester King's Arthur,

860
01:02:18,856 --> 01:02:21,676
head of a spy agency;
It's called Kingsman.

861
01:02:21,752 --> 01:02:24,752
Thank you Charlie. Much appreciated.

862
01:02:24,776 --> 01:02:26,776
Come on, It wasn't the fucking deal

863
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,624
I had such high hopes for you.

864
01:02:38,649 --> 01:02:40,676
You are a bloody disgrace.

865
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:42,252
I'm so sorry

866
01:02:42,277 --> 01:02:44,076
Please untie me.

867
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:45,852
Untie yourself.

868
01:02:47,352 --> 01:02:50,052
Arthur, please.

869
01:02:53,898 --> 01:02:55,898
Anyone?...No

870
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:58,952
Galahad, Percival. Congratulations.

871
01:02:59,052 --> 01:03:01,851
You candidates have reached the
final stage of the testing process.

872
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:05,747
As tradition allows, you now have
24 hours to spend with them.

873
01:03:06,352 --> 01:03:07,574
Eggsy, you should know

874
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,376
your father reached this point.

875
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:10,952
From now on,

876
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:13,476
there are no safety nets.
Understood?

877
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:18,452
Good. Dismissed.

878
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:24,652
Charlie, time to go home.

879
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,282
Fuck you

880
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:28,228
My fucking dad's gonna hear about this.

881
01:03:30,752 --> 01:03:32,752
"To pee or not to pee?"

882
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:37,402
That was the headline the day after I
diffused a dirty bomb in Paris.

883
01:03:37,952 --> 01:03:40,769
- "Germany 1 - England 5."
- I missed that game.

884
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:43,912
I was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at Pentagon.

885
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:50,227
My first mission.

886
01:03:50,252 --> 01:03:53,702
I foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

887
01:03:53,778 --> 01:03:55,751
Not everybody had thanked you for that one.

888
01:03:55,852 --> 01:03:58,971
The point is, Eggsy, nobody thanked
me for any of them.

889
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:02,803
Front page news, and all these occasions
were celebrity nonsense.

890
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:06,768
Because it is the nature of Kingsman that
our achievements remain secret.

891
01:04:06,952 --> 01:04:10,252
A gentleman's name should appear in the
newspaper only three times:

892
01:04:10,352 --> 01:04:12,852
When he's born, when he
marries and when he dies.

893
01:04:12,952 --> 01:04:16,352
And we are, first and foremost, gentlemen.

894
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:17,668
Pretty fucked then.

895
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:21,300
Its like Charlie said,
I am just a pleb.

896
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,112
Being a gentleman has nothing to do with
the circumstances of one's birth.

897
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:27,252
Being a gentleman is something one learns.

898
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,406
Yeah, but how?

899
01:04:30,057 --> 01:04:31,313
Alright, first lesson,

900
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:34,192
you should have asked me
before you took a seat.

901
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:36,795
Second lesson,

902
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,225
how to make a proper martini.

903
01:04:39,245 --> 01:04:41,649
Yes, Harry.

904
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,175
Goddamn it. It fucking hurts.

905
01:04:48,353 --> 01:04:50,801
You are the one who asked for
a biometric security system.

906
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:52,277
What's wrong with
a simple switch?

907
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:53,727
A simple switch?

908
01:04:53,752 --> 01:04:57,276
This is an extremely
dangerous machine.

909
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:01,852
It should only be operated by someone
responsible and sane as me.

910
01:05:02,052 --> 01:05:05,040
Bad shit can happen
if it falls into the wrong hands.

911
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:07,352
SYNC MAIN TERMINAL

912
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:10,983
- Are we done here? Shit
- No, now this one,

913
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:13,176
for the test of the church.

914
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:17,252
This one just has a short range.
A simple switch will do.

915
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,830
So you gonna teach me how to talk proper
like in 'My Fair Lady'?

916
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:26,977
That'd be absurd.

917
01:05:27,002 --> 01:05:30,076
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.

918
01:05:30,252 --> 01:05:32,752
Its about being at ease in one's own skin.

919
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:37,183
As Hemingway said:"There is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man."

920
01:05:37,352 --> 01:05:41,348
"True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

921
01:05:45,652 --> 01:05:47,933
Now, the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.

922
01:05:48,052 --> 01:05:51,352
By which I mean a bespoke suit.
Never off the peg.

923
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:53,848
And Kingsman suits are
always bulletproof,

924
01:05:53,873 --> 01:05:55,376
So let's get you measured.

925
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,275
And whether you get the job
or not, you will have a

926
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,176
lasting and useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.

927
01:06:01,452 --> 01:06:05,152
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

928
01:06:05,452 --> 01:06:07,234
Fitting Room 2 is available.

929
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:09,676
One does not use
Fitting Room 2...

930
01:06:09,752 --> 01:06:12,302
when one is popping one's cherry.

931
01:06:12,752 --> 01:06:16,252
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting
Room 3, while we wait.

932
01:06:25,852 --> 01:06:28,352
- So we going up or down?
- Neither.

933
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:33,952
- Is this it?
- Of course not. Pull the hook on your left.

934
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:42,412
Oh, Yes

935
01:06:42,452 --> 01:06:44,952
Very very nice.

936
01:06:47,852 --> 01:06:50,352
You're going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit.

937
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:54,552
An Oxford is any formal shoe,
with open lacing.

938
01:06:54,652 --> 01:06:57,852
This additional decorative
piece is called broguing.

939
01:06:57,952 --> 01:07:01,311
- "Oxford's, not brogue's."
- Words to live by, Eggsy.

940
01:07:01,336 --> 01:07:02,476
Words to live by.

941
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,152
Try a pair.

942
01:07:04,381 --> 01:07:06,500
Your weapon scores are
excellent, by the way.

943
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:08,799
These you're familiar with.

944
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:10,852
And this is our standard issue pistol.

945
01:07:10,952 --> 01:07:13,413
Its quite unique. As you all
see it, it also fires a

946
01:07:13,438 --> 01:07:16,176
shotgun cartridge for use in
messy close-range situations.

947
01:07:16,252 --> 01:07:19,087
How do they feel? Now do your
very best in impersonation

948
01:07:19,112 --> 01:07:21,276
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.

949
01:07:24,652 --> 01:07:25,852
No, Eggsy.

950
01:07:29,652 --> 01:07:31,152
That is sick.

951
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:34,172
In the old days, they had a
phone in the heel as well.

952
01:07:34,193 --> 01:07:35,362
How do I get it back in?

953
01:07:35,463 --> 01:07:38,177
It is coated with one
of the fastest-acting

954
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:40,976
neurotoxins known to
man, so very carefully.

955
01:07:44,252 --> 01:07:46,752
I had a lot of fun with this.

956
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:49,552
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

957
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:52,203
Poison. Harmless when ingested.

958
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:54,676
But at a time,
convenient to you...

959
01:07:54,752 --> 01:07:57,752
it can be remotely activated.

960
01:07:57,952 --> 01:07:59,052
Primed.

961
01:08:00,139 --> 01:08:01,252
Lethal.

962
01:08:02,552 --> 01:08:05,962
And what about these? What do these do?
Electrocute you?

963
01:08:06,063 --> 01:08:08,706
- Don't be ridiculous. It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up...

964
01:08:08,807 --> 01:08:11,352
If you want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

965
01:08:11,452 --> 01:08:14,259
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand, but

966
01:08:14,284 --> 01:08:16,875
a Kingsman wears it on whatever
hand happens to be dominant.

967
01:08:17,013 --> 01:08:19,952
If you touch the contact behind the ring,
it delivers 50,000 volts.

968
01:08:21,352 --> 01:08:24,152
And what about them? What
makes them so special?

969
01:08:24,452 --> 01:08:27,452
Nothing. That technology is caught up
with the spy world.

970
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:30,947
Put it back, Eggsy.

971
01:08:34,052 --> 01:08:36,552
Perfect timing. Gentleman's just finished.

972
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:42,952
Mr. DeVere.

973
01:08:44,352 --> 01:08:46,184
What a coincidence.

974
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:49,776
You're totally the
reason I'm here.

975
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:54,824
When you left my house, I was searching for
that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on.

976
01:08:54,925 --> 01:08:58,752
And since I'm going as Royal Ascot, apparently
you need one of these penguin suits...

977
01:08:59,252 --> 01:09:01,952
Here I am. What are you doing here?

978
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:04,652
What's up man? Richmond Valentine.

979
01:09:05,052 --> 01:09:08,134
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

980
01:09:08,235 --> 01:09:11,052
Another coincidence. So am I.

981
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:14,752
- Did you have any chance to think further on my proposal?
- Most definitely.

982
01:09:15,052 --> 01:09:18,352
My people will be getting in
touch with you very soon.

983
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:19,476
I guarantee it.

984
01:09:20,352 --> 01:09:24,515
A word of advice: Ascot requires top hat.

985
01:09:25,252 --> 01:09:29,002
I might suggest Lock & Co.
Hatters,

986
01:09:29,027 --> 01:09:30,276
St. James.

987
01:09:30,352 --> 01:09:32,547
"Lox", as in smoked fish?

988
01:09:32,572 --> 01:09:34,502
As in "locked up".

989
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:40,587
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

990
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,452
You all talk so funny.

991
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:53,184
Gentlemen, would you look after him please?

992
01:10:05,752 --> 01:10:08,752
Now this is a dope-ass top hat.

993
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:13,952
Gazelle, lets go Ascotting.

994
01:10:15,452 --> 01:10:19,452
<i>Your hat is fine Bill, come on.
Don't make me late for the queen.</i>

995
01:10:20,452 --> 01:10:22,952
<i>Come on, Gazelle. We're gonna be late.</i>

996
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:26,352
<i>How far is Ascot? How far?</i>

997
01:10:30,552 --> 01:10:32,802
Merlin said you wanted
to see me, sir?

998
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:33,827
Sit down.

999
01:10:39,052 --> 01:10:42,052
Pretty dog. What's his name?

1000
01:10:42,152 --> 01:10:43,006
J.B.

1001
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:45,417
- As in "James Bond"?
- No.

1002
01:10:45,652 --> 01:10:49,852
- "Jason Bourne"?
- No. Jack Bauer.

1003
01:10:51,443 --> 01:10:52,552
Bravo.

1004
01:10:53,152 --> 01:10:55,847
It pains me to admit it,
Eggsy, but I think that

1005
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:58,676
one day you might be as
good a spy as any of them.

1006
01:11:06,152 --> 01:11:07,713
Take it.

1007
01:11:14,552 --> 01:11:15,752
Shoot the dog.

1008
01:11:22,552 --> 01:11:24,252
This weapon is live.

1009
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:28,352
Shoot the dog.

1010
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:08,152
Give me the gun.

1011
01:12:18,952 --> 01:12:21,152
At least the girl's got balls,

1012
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:25,627
Get out.

1013
01:12:25,652 --> 01:12:28,276
I knew you couldn't make it.

1014
01:12:31,652 --> 01:12:33,152
Go home.

1015
01:12:34,652 --> 01:12:37,352
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

1016
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:06,152
Welcome to Kingsman, Lancelot.

1017
01:13:32,452 --> 01:13:35,652
Oh god, I've been so worried about you.

1018
01:13:37,552 --> 01:13:40,997
Oh my Dais, look how big you've got.

1019
01:13:46,852 --> 01:13:48,130
- Where is he?
- I am fine.

1020
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:50,711
Eggsy, please please, just
don't get involved...

1021
01:13:50,787 --> 01:13:53,927
No, I should never have
left you on your own.

1022
01:13:53,952 --> 01:13:55,385
This stops right now.

1023
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:56,500
Be right back.

1024
01:14:02,247 --> 01:14:04,747
Oh Mugsy, so you're back?

1025
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:06,797
You nicked a fucking taxi now?

1026
01:14:07,852 --> 01:14:10,516
Yeah. Can I have a word about my mom's
black eye?

1027
01:14:11,116 --> 01:14:13,043
You wanna have a word with
me, you get out of that cab,

1028
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:15,465
I'll knock you straight back
down on your fucking arse.

1029
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:20,499
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

1030
01:14:21,752 --> 01:14:26,013
Go on lads. There'll be two hits:
Me and him and then he and the floor.

1031
01:14:26,452 --> 01:14:30,952
Come on in, you prick.
Let's see what you got, eh.

1032
01:14:31,052 --> 01:14:32,232
What are you doing?

1033
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:35,300
Remote car.
What are you doing?

1034
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:36,943
Now you've gone all bollocks.

1035
01:14:37,966 --> 01:14:39,778
Come on, he'll beat my fucking mother.

1036
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:42,283
Come back when you've grown a pair. Mugsy.

1037
01:15:05,575 --> 01:15:06,707
You throw away

1038
01:15:06,732 --> 01:15:08,542
your biggest opportunity

1039
01:15:08,566 --> 01:15:10,149
over a fucking dog.

1040
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:13,558
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

1041
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,839
You shot a dog just
to get a fucking job?

1042
01:15:16,864 --> 01:15:17,903
Yes, I did.

1043
01:15:20,452 --> 01:15:24,091
Mr Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit.

1044
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:28,252
You shot your dog
and had it stuffed?

1045
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:30,151
You fucking freak.

1046
01:15:30,252 --> 01:15:31,199
No. I shot my dog and

1047
01:15:31,224 --> 01:15:33,319
then I brought him home
and continued to care

1048
01:15:33,345 --> 01:15:36,276
for him for the next eleven years
until he died of pancreatitis.

1049
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:39,849
- What?
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

1050
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,417
It was a fucking blank.

1051
01:15:42,722 --> 01:15:44,624
Remember Amelia?

1052
01:15:44,648 --> 01:15:45,251
Yeah

1053
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:49,552
She didn't drown. She works in our tech
department in Berlin. She's fine.

1054
01:15:49,652 --> 01:15:53,652
Limits must be tested. A Kingsman only condones
the risking of a life to save another.

1055
01:15:53,752 --> 01:15:56,851
As my father saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his?

1056
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,281
What you've get him stuffed here also?

1057
01:16:00,652 --> 01:16:03,852
Can't you see that everything I have done
has been about trying to repay him?

1058
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:10,582
Harry, listen to this.

1059
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:13,073
Valentine's alarm is
saying something of note.

1060
01:16:13,452 --> 01:16:15,784
<i>You know what I love about pen and paper?</i>

1061
01:16:16,152 --> 01:16:18,652
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1062
01:16:19,152 --> 01:16:22,352
Our worldwide tour was a complete success.

1063
01:16:22,652 --> 01:16:25,138
We have total coverall.

1064
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:28,985
- Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out.
- Bingo!

1065
01:16:29,405 --> 01:16:33,327
Bingo, the game.
You have played Bingo, right?

1066
01:16:33,452 --> 01:16:35,452
Do I look like I play bingo?

1067
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,606
Point is...

1068
01:16:39,152 --> 01:16:43,352
<i>if our tests go well at church tomorrow,
we are good to go.</i>

1069
01:16:43,652 --> 01:16:46,317
South Glade Mission Church.

1070
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:49,352
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
- Will do

1071
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:52,152
- I am so sorry. I'm gonna do..
- You should be.

1072
01:16:52,352 --> 01:16:55,052
You stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

1073
01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:01,249
"Kentucky, U.S.A"

1074
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:04,250
<i>And I say to you: Bear witness</i>.

1075
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:07,636
Watch the news. Watch the news.

1076
01:17:07,737 --> 01:17:12,501
AIDS, floods
The blood of the innocents spilled.

1077
01:17:12,602 --> 01:17:17,602
And yet there are those
who doubt this is the wrath of God.

1078
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:23,202
Our filthy government condones sodomy.

1079
01:17:23,502 --> 01:17:26,002
Divorce, abortion.

1080
01:17:26,402 --> 01:17:28,982
And yet some still doubt,

1081
01:17:29,007 --> 01:17:32,825
this is the work
of the Antichrist.

1082
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:37,369
You do not have to be a
Jew, a nigger, a whore...

1083
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:41,064
or an atheistic science
loving evolution spouter.

1084
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,527
<i>Charming sermon.</i>

1085
01:17:42,552 --> 01:17:44,640
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

1086
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:49,519
So my friends, although he is a just God,
he is justly...

1087
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:52,507
The One and there will be no turning back

1088
01:17:54,352 --> 01:17:55,729
Are you sure we
are out of range?

1089
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,576
We're over a 1000 feet away.
What's wrong?

1090
01:17:57,652 --> 01:18:00,652
- What if the calculations are wrong?
- You just have to trust me.

1091
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:04,400
Jews, nigger, fag lovers.

1092
01:18:04,552 --> 01:18:08,052
And the devil is burning
them for all eternity.

1093
01:18:08,152 --> 01:18:09,352
Excuse me.

1094
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,874
Where are you going?

1095
01:18:11,899 --> 01:18:13,876
Hey, what's your problem?

1096
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,016
I am a Catholic whore,
currently enjoying congress

1097
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,851
out of wedlock with my
black Jewish boyfriend...

1098
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,367
who works in a military abortion clinic.

1099
01:18:23,552 --> 01:18:27,177
So hail Satan. And have a
lovely afternoon, madam.

1100
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:33,543
Oh shit, he's leaving. I'm
starting the test now.

1101
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,352
Hope enough of these
freaks have our SIM cards.

1102
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,850
Ask you to sit down...

1103
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:46,092
Leave this church like the infidel you are.

1104
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:54,952
You will eat your babies.
You will drown in the blood of the Lord.

1105
01:18:55,052 --> 01:18:57,246
He will cast.

1106
01:19:03,298 --> 01:19:04,530
Holy fuck.

1107
01:19:05,748 --> 01:19:08,121
Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

1108
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Jesus...

1109
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:55,252
<i>Galahad, can you hear me?</i>

1110
01:19:55,752 --> 01:19:58,952
Harry, Harry.. what the heck is going on?

1111
01:20:00,752 --> 01:20:02,072
Just turn the volume down please.

1112
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:05,060
I didn't expect it to
be that effective.

1113
01:20:05,085 --> 01:20:06,876
What kind of response
are we talking of?

1114
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:08,552
100%.

1115
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:12,752
So everyone's been infected
Whether they have SIM card or not?

1116
01:20:12,952 --> 01:20:15,452
And its added benefit of
wiping out the Kingsman.

1117
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,501
Not yet.

1118
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:14,152
Oh you need to see this.

1119
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:14,722
What did you do to me?
I had no control.

1120
01:23:15,952 --> 01:23:18,152
I killed all those people.

1121
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:21,852
- I wanted to.
- Clever, isn't it?

1122
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:25,145
In simple terms, its a
neurological wave that triggers

1123
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:28,362
the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitor.

1124
01:23:28,452 --> 01:23:31,952
Transmitted through your nasty
free SIM cards, I assume?

1125
01:23:35,152 --> 01:23:36,878
You know what this is like?

1126
01:23:37,052 --> 01:23:40,452
Its like those old movies we both love.

1127
01:23:40,552 --> 01:23:42,752
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan...

1128
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:46,752
and then I'm gonna come up with some
absurd, convoluted way to kill you...

1129
01:23:46,852 --> 01:23:49,952
and then you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

1130
01:23:50,752 --> 01:23:52,252
That sounds good to me.

1131
01:23:53,052 --> 01:23:55,052
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1132
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,480
No

1133
01:24:09,452 --> 01:24:11,213
Is he dead?

1134
01:24:11,352 --> 01:24:13,832
That's usually what happens when
you shoot someone in the head.

1135
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:18,316
- It feels good, Right?
- No no, it does not feel good. It felt fucking awful.

1136
01:24:18,652 --> 01:24:21,202
What? You just killed how
many people in that church.

1137
01:24:21,227 --> 01:24:22,076
This is one guy.

1138
01:24:22,152 --> 01:24:24,352
No..No... No, they killed each other.

1139
01:24:26,652 --> 01:24:29,183
Okay, send off the
countdown clock

1140
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:31,176
This party starts tomorrow.

1141
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:07,307
Arthur?

1142
01:25:09,352 --> 01:25:13,052
- Are you there?
- <i>Sadly, I am</i>.

1143
01:25:13,652 --> 01:25:16,645
Assemble the Kingsman.

1144
01:25:21,152 --> 01:25:25,175
<i>Can't you see that everything I have done
has been about trying to repay him?</i>

1145
01:25:45,544 --> 01:25:47,730
<i>I see a young man
with potential,</i>

1146
01:25:47,755 --> 01:25:50,776
<i>who wants to do something
good with his life.</i>

1147
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
<i>Kingsman</i>

1148
01:26:07,952 --> 01:26:10,452
Arthur, Harry is dead.

1149
01:26:11,052 --> 01:26:13,002
Galahad is dead.

1150
01:26:13,552 --> 01:26:16,552
Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.

1151
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:19,268
Well then you know what
that psycho's doing.

1152
01:26:19,369 --> 01:26:21,953
How many people in the world
have got those SIM cards?

1153
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,822
Valentine can send a signal
to any of them.

1154
01:26:23,847 --> 01:26:27,075
All of them. If they all go homicidal at
the same time, then..

1155
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:29,443
Indeed, and thanks to
Galahad recordings

1156
01:26:29,568 --> 01:26:31,800
we have Valentine's confession.

1157
01:26:32,052 --> 01:26:35,552
The intelligence has been passed on to the
relevant authorities.

1158
01:26:35,752 --> 01:26:37,252
Our work is complete.

1159
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:41,776
And a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend it is too.

1160
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:43,752
And that's it?

1161
01:26:44,752 --> 01:26:46,452
Come sit down, boy.

1162
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:54,552
This is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy.

1163
01:26:55,452 --> 01:26:59,352
And we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1164
01:26:59,452 --> 01:27:02,223
Galahad was very fond of you.

1165
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:08,452
And on this occasion, I think it is
acceptable for us...

1166
01:27:09,452 --> 01:27:11,152
to bend the rules a little.

1167
01:27:12,652 --> 01:27:16,152
- These are all Kingsmen?
- Yes, our founder members.

1168
01:27:17,852 --> 01:27:20,352
I want you to join me in a toast.

1169
01:27:22,252 --> 01:27:23,452
To Galahad.

1170
01:27:26,009 --> 01:27:28,009
To Galahad.

1171
01:27:31,252 --> 01:27:34,335
Harry said you don't like
to break the rules, often.

1172
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,387
Why now?

1173
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:37,208
You're very good, Eggsy.

1174
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:41,370
Perhaps I'll make you my
proposal for Galahad's position.

1175
01:27:41,552 --> 01:27:44,011
Provided we can see eye to eye

1176
01:27:44,036 --> 01:27:46,576
on certain political matters.

1177
01:27:49,452 --> 01:27:51,391
Can you guess..

1178
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:53,504
What this is?

1179
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:55,921
I don't have to.
Harry showed it.

1180
01:27:55,946 --> 01:27:57,218
You click it, I die.

1181
01:27:57,352 --> 01:27:59,552
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1182
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:02,052
Bravo.

1183
01:28:02,352 --> 01:28:05,552
Valentine won you over. Somehow

1184
01:28:05,752 --> 01:28:08,752
Once he explained, I understood.

1185
01:28:08,852 --> 01:28:11,352
When you get a virus, you get a fever.

1186
01:28:11,652 --> 01:28:15,445
That's the human body raising its
core temperature to kill the virus.

1187
01:28:15,852 --> 01:28:20,352
Planet Earth works the same way:
Global warming is the fever...

1188
01:28:20,452 --> 01:28:22,512
Mankind is the virus.

1189
01:28:22,537 --> 01:28:25,676
We are making our planet sick.

1190
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:28,434
A cull is our only hope.

1191
01:28:28,552 --> 01:28:31,255
If we do not reduce our
population ourselves,

1192
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,277
there's only two
ways this can go:

1193
01:28:33,852 --> 01:28:37,852
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.

1194
01:28:38,352 --> 01:28:41,243
- Either way...
- The result is the same:

1195
01:28:41,852 --> 01:28:44,052
The virus dies.

1196
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:48,193
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

1197
01:28:48,452 --> 01:28:51,052
If we don't do something, Nature will.

1198
01:28:51,152 --> 01:28:55,152
Sometimes a culling is the only way to
ensure that this species survives.

1199
01:28:56,152 --> 01:29:01,052
And History will see Valentine as the man
who saved humanity from extinction.

1200
01:29:01,152 --> 01:29:04,152
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

1201
01:29:04,552 --> 01:29:08,632
All his rich mates, they get to live. And then when
he thinks its worth saving, he's keeping them safe.

1202
01:29:08,852 --> 01:29:13,352
- Whether they agree with him or not.
- And you, Eggsy.

1203
01:29:13,652 --> 01:29:20,115
In Harry's honor, I am inviting you to
be part of a new world.

1204
01:29:22,552 --> 01:29:25,252
It's time to make your decision.

1205
01:29:31,752 --> 01:29:34,527
I would rather be with Harry.

1206
01:29:34,552 --> 01:29:35,552
Thanks.

1207
01:29:35,852 --> 01:29:37,052
So be it.

1208
01:29:53,652 --> 01:29:56,560
The problem with us
common types is,

1209
01:29:56,585 --> 01:29:58,785
that we are light fingered.

1210
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:01,480
Kingsman's taught me a lot.

1211
01:30:01,505 --> 01:30:02,976
But slight of hand...

1212
01:30:03,452 --> 01:30:05,152
<i>Yes, they're our our founder members.</i>

1213
01:30:07,761 --> 01:30:09,652
I had that done already.

1214
01:30:12,392 --> 01:30:16,698
You dirty little fucking prick.

1215
01:30:51,052 --> 01:30:55,739
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down.
It's verified.

1216
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:59,889
Arthur's phone's just
received an update text about

1217
01:30:59,914 --> 01:31:01,676
getting to safety. We
don't have a lot time.

1218
01:31:01,752 --> 01:31:04,517
- What you gonna do?
- The question is what we gonna do.

1219
01:31:04,852 --> 01:31:07,352
God knows who's in Valentine's
pocket and who's not.

1220
01:31:08,252 --> 01:31:09,779
We've no choice.

1221
01:31:10,752 --> 01:31:12,952
We are gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

1222
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:17,533
Follow me.

1223
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:40,651
- The fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

1224
01:31:40,752 --> 01:31:42,086
What you're playing with...

1225
01:31:42,187 --> 01:31:44,944
is a prototype personal
trans-atmospheric vehicle.

1226
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:48,096
It was developed as part of
Reagan's Star Wars project.

1227
01:31:48,121 --> 01:31:50,475
Its pretty basic, but
it should still work.

1228
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:53,052
We're going to take out one
of Valentine's satellites.

1229
01:31:53,352 --> 01:31:55,852
We're gonna break the chain.
Stop the signal.

1230
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:58,052
It will take him a couple
of hours to reboot it.

1231
01:31:58,252 --> 01:32:02,422
Which buys us enough time for you to get me
into Valentine's mainframe...

1232
01:32:02,522 --> 01:32:04,522
so I can shut it down.

1233
01:32:04,861 --> 01:32:08,852
Lancelot, you are going to be using it.
Get into your halo suit.

1234
01:32:17,852 --> 01:32:20,352
Swedish Air Force

1235
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:23,652
<i>The Swedish Prime Minister requesting
permission to land.</i>

1236
01:32:28,852 --> 01:32:30,744
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1237
01:32:34,452 --> 01:32:36,452
- Please.
- Thank you.

1238
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:40,626
- So how many more are we expecting?
- Not many. Most have their own bunkers.

1239
01:32:40,952 --> 01:32:43,939
I figure we're just getting
really nervous once.

1240
01:32:44,452 --> 01:32:46,152
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1241
01:32:47,752 --> 01:32:51,052
It seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal...

1242
01:32:51,152 --> 01:32:54,540
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM card.

1243
01:32:54,752 --> 01:32:56,952
The waves that turns everyone
into a psycho killer?

1244
01:32:57,052 --> 01:32:59,605
Quite. But what they probably didn't
tell anyone...

1245
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:03,729
Is that it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command.

1246
01:33:04,052 --> 01:33:08,121
Valentine's selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning.

1247
01:33:08,552 --> 01:33:11,392
He had to be sure that it didn't
blow up to the wrong people beforehand.

1248
01:33:11,452 --> 01:33:13,395
And how does this help us right now?

1249
01:33:14,352 --> 01:33:17,052
It doesn't. Roxy, here we go.

1250
01:33:29,752 --> 01:33:33,012
The higher you go,
The more the balloons expand.

1251
01:33:33,452 --> 01:33:36,952
When you reach the edge of the atmosphere,
they will explode.

1252
01:33:37,652 --> 01:33:40,018
You need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

1253
01:33:40,043 --> 01:33:41,310
The edge of the atmosphere.

1254
01:33:41,452 --> 01:33:44,652
And once you've deployed, you'll need
to release for descent fast.

1255
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:46,893
Good luck.

1256
01:33:49,152 --> 01:33:50,746
You can do this, okay?

1257
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:54,187
Eggsy, come on.
Time is not our friend.

1258
01:34:16,852 --> 01:34:20,152
Getting in with Arthur's invitation,
you gonna need to blend in.

1259
01:34:20,252 --> 01:34:23,972
- I'm supposed to be Arthur?
- His invitation's in his phone.

1260
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:26,552
Give them this and give
his real name: Chester King.

1261
01:34:26,752 --> 01:34:29,252
- And what about you?
- I'm the pilot. I'm gonna stay here.

1262
01:34:29,952 --> 01:34:31,486
Is that gonna fit me?

1263
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:33,774
A bespoke suit always fits.

1264
01:34:34,052 --> 01:34:36,677
Just be grateful Harry
had it made for you.

1265
01:34:36,702 --> 01:34:37,702
Get dressed.

1266
01:34:39,452 --> 01:34:40,639
The fuck's wrong with them?

1267
01:34:40,664 --> 01:34:43,476
I don't know. Could have something
to do with mass genocide?

1268
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:45,638
Give me the mic.

1269
01:34:49,052 --> 01:34:50,552
Everybody listen up.

1270
01:34:52,048 --> 01:34:54,458
What the fuck wrong with you people?

1271
01:34:54,652 --> 01:35:00,152
I just want to remind you that today
is a day of celebration.

1272
01:35:01,052 --> 01:35:04,566
We must put aside
all thoughts of death,

1273
01:35:04,591 --> 01:35:06,810
and focus on birth.

1274
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:10,891
The birth of a new age.

1275
01:35:11,252 --> 01:35:15,452
<i>We mustn't mourn those who
give their lives today.</i>

1276
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,652
<i>We should honor their sacrifice.</i>

1277
01:35:18,752 --> 01:35:20,652
She got my number to call me back...?

1278
01:35:20,752 --> 01:35:24,452
<i>And their role in saving
the human race.</i>

1279
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:31,292
We must put aside doubts and guilts.

1280
01:35:31,552 --> 01:35:35,752
You are the chosen people.

1281
01:35:36,652 --> 01:35:41,652
When folks tell their kids the story
of Noah's Ark, is Noah the bad guy?

1282
01:35:42,152 --> 01:35:44,852
Is God the bad guy?

1283
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:48,152
How about the animals marching two by two?

1284
01:35:48,652 --> 01:35:50,152
Of course not.

1285
01:35:50,752 --> 01:35:55,752
Yes, that's it. So let's turn
that frown upside down.

1286
01:35:56,352 --> 01:36:02,071
Eat, drink and party.

1287
01:36:02,952 --> 01:36:05,952
And I'll see you all in the new age.

1288
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:34,199
<i>Rox, its me. How's the view?</i>

1289
01:36:37,152 --> 01:36:39,552
- Hideous.
<i>- Mine's pretty sweet.</i>

1290
01:36:39,652 --> 01:36:42,507
- They made you one of these suits yet?
<i>- No, not yet.</i>

1291
01:36:42,652 --> 01:36:45,069
<i>That's something to
look forward to then.</i>

1292
01:36:45,094 --> 01:36:47,798
<i>We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.</i>

1293
01:36:49,252 --> 01:36:50,559
<i>Good luck.</i>

1294
01:36:58,052 --> 01:36:59,752
Looking good, Eggsy.

1295
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:04,101
Feeling good, Merlin.

1296
01:37:09,752 --> 01:37:13,791
This is November 2-4-7 Charlie Kilo
requesting permission to land.

1297
01:37:16,952 --> 01:37:18,452
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

1298
01:37:23,403 --> 01:37:25,786
Fuck me.

1299
01:37:52,244 --> 01:37:54,450
Eggsy, We're on.

1300
01:38:09,352 --> 01:38:10,552
Chester King.

1301
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:12,970
Mr. King, welcome.

1302
01:38:13,157 --> 01:38:17,525
I'm sure you've adhered to Mr Valentine's
strict no weapons policy...

1303
01:38:17,552 --> 01:38:18,196
but if you don't object..

1304
01:38:18,212 --> 01:38:19,778
- Of course.
- Thank you

1305
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:22,440
Do you have any luggage?

1306
01:38:23,452 --> 01:38:27,352
Congratulations, Mycroft. You just
graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1307
01:38:27,452 --> 01:38:30,077
- Cheeky.
- Understood?

1308
01:38:30,102 --> 01:38:31,102
Good.

1309
01:38:32,552 --> 01:38:33,806
Thank you.

1310
01:38:59,852 --> 01:39:02,988
<i>Eggsy, find a laptop.
Get me online.</i>

1311
01:39:03,013 --> 01:39:04,876
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

1312
01:39:05,352 --> 01:39:08,052
<i>And remember: Try to blend in.</i>

1313
01:39:08,352 --> 01:39:10,352
Would sir care for a drink?

1314
01:39:10,852 --> 01:39:12,301
Martini. Gin,

1315
01:39:12,326 --> 01:39:14,776
not vodka, obviously.

1316
01:39:14,852 --> 01:39:18,602
Stirred for 10 seconds while glancing
it an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1317
01:39:18,627 --> 01:39:19,876
Thank you.

1318
01:39:22,952 --> 01:39:24,914
Merlin, you clock in this?

1319
01:39:24,939 --> 01:39:26,976
Yes I am. Stay focused.

1320
01:39:27,652 --> 01:39:30,152
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1321
01:39:30,452 --> 01:39:31,652
<i>Yes, Merlin.</i>

1322
01:39:33,152 --> 01:39:35,352
<i>Eggsy, get me online. Now.</i>

1323
01:39:36,652 --> 01:39:37,852
Yep. I'm on it.

1324
01:39:38,952 --> 01:39:41,480
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1325
01:39:41,505 --> 01:39:43,476
These balloons won't
last much longer.

1326
01:39:44,152 --> 01:39:45,852
<i>Start to engage missile.</i>

1327
01:40:01,452 --> 01:40:04,452
The society is dead.
Long live society.

1328
01:40:05,952 --> 01:40:07,152
Amen to that.

1329
01:40:08,952 --> 01:40:11,077
- Morten Lindström.
- Chester King.

1330
01:40:11,102 --> 01:40:12,476
How'd you get online?

1331
01:40:12,552 --> 01:40:16,333
Oh well, it's a closed network, you see.
For authorized connections only.

1332
01:40:20,052 --> 01:40:21,652
I've got a fix on the satellite.

1333
01:40:21,752 --> 01:40:22,438
Do you have the correct time?

1334
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:24,071
I think I'm still
on my last time zone.

1335
01:40:24,142 --> 01:40:25,950
Oh yeah. Lets see now.

1336
01:40:39,928 --> 01:40:41,840
Eggsy, I'm in. Get
your arse back to the plane now.

1337
01:40:41,841 --> 01:40:42,633
I'm on my way.

1338
01:40:42,652 --> 01:40:46,152
Lancelot, good luck.
Firing in three, two...

1339
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:54,552
Nice and slow.

1340
01:40:54,653 --> 01:40:56,031
What the fuck are
you doing here?

1341
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:58,163
Well, my family was naturally invited.
Obviously.

1342
01:40:58,269 --> 01:41:00,269
Now get the fuck up. Slowly.

1343
01:41:01,811 --> 01:41:03,147
Lancelot, hurry up and fire.

1344
01:41:03,172 --> 01:41:04,794
The other balloon is gonna blow.

1345
01:41:04,956 --> 01:41:08,020
<i>Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second.</i>

1346
01:41:09,856 --> 01:41:12,835
Valentine, I've caught a fucking spy.

1347
01:41:13,202 --> 01:41:14,858
V-Glass, zoom.

1348
01:41:15,794 --> 01:41:17,794
It's that young valet.

1349
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:22,173
Son of a bitch.

1350
01:41:22,273 --> 01:41:23,443
<i>Got it.</i>

1351
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:35,652
Oh shit. Sound the alarm.

1352
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:39,007
I'm not taking any chances.

1353
01:41:39,178 --> 01:41:41,862
Okay, you send out two minutes warnings.
I'm starting the override.

1354
01:41:44,852 --> 01:41:46,352
<i>Countdown initiated.</i>

1355
01:41:55,652 --> 01:41:57,152
- You see him?
- Right here.

1356
01:42:06,352 --> 01:42:09,552
Eggsy, take a left. Two guards up ahead.

1357
01:42:21,852 --> 01:42:23,552
Lancelot, release now.

1358
01:42:33,952 --> 01:42:36,952
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead and then right.
There's two more.</i>

1359
01:42:40,852 --> 01:42:44,252
All right, everybody on your feet.
Countdown to V-Day.

1360
01:42:44,752 --> 01:42:46,452
<i>Welcome into new age.</i>

1361
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:13,625
Eggsy, next left. Got a narrow tunnel.

1362
01:43:22,248 --> 01:43:23,565
<i>Here we go.</i>

1363
01:43:23,589 --> 01:43:24,589

Nine...

01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,500
Eight...

1366
01:43:28,971 --> 01:43:29,371
Seven...

1367
01:43:29,661 --> 01:43:31,661
Six...

1368

Come on.

- Let's go the fuck out of here.
- We can't.

1390
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:54,814
I can't get into
Valentine's machine.

1394
01:45:02,262 --> 01:45:03,373
I'm afraid not.

Let's me have that then.

1396
01:45:09,406 --> 01:45:10,725
This is mine.

1397
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:12,980
I'll show you yours.

1398
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:31,690
Good choice.

1399
01:45:34,373 --> 01:45:35,907
How long to relink
the satellite chain?

1400
01:45:35,932 --> 01:45:37,234
It can take an hour.
Maybe two.

1401
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:39,740
Bullshit. Just bring these
two closer together.

1402
01:45:39,741 --> 01:45:41,602
But that's not yours.

1403
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:48,494
V-glass, call E-man.

1404
01:45:49,352 --> 01:45:52,831
E, its V. Listen man, I got a
little hiccup on this end.

1405
01:45:52,856 --> 01:45:54,076
I need a piggyback.

1406
01:45:54,152 --> 01:45:58,014
One of my satellites just went
down but is right next to one of yours.

1407
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:02,352
You read my mind. How long before you
make that happen?

1408
01:46:05,352 --> 01:46:06,528
Go.

1409
01:46:10,552 --> 01:46:12,552

Valentine using someone else's satellite.

1412
01:46:23,508 --> 01:46:24,618
He's gonna reconnect the chain.

1413
01:46:24,643 --> 01:46:26,484
Its gonna take him no time at all.

1414

Its at 20%.

1415
01:46:46,152 --> 01:46:49,352
Eggsy, Valentine's got a present for you.
Get a move on.

1416
01:47:23,052 --> 01:47:26,252
- Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?
- Not yet. But he will be soon.

1417
01:47:26,352 --> 01:47:27,597
Good.

1418
01:47:40,992 --> 01:47:42,718
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1419
01:47:55,157 --> 01:47:56,322
As am I.

1420
01:47:56,446 --> 01:47:59,091
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

1421
01:47:59,252 --> 01:48:01,752
Rox, I need a favor.

1422
01:48:02,126 --> 01:48:05,596
Call my mum and tell her to
lock herself away from Dean

1423
01:48:05,621 --> 01:48:06,777
and the baby.

1424
01:48:08,252 --> 01:48:09,752
And tell her I love her.

1425
01:48:23,752 --> 01:48:27,252
Merlin, you remember those implants you
said were of no use to us?

1426
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,441
Any chance you could turn them on?

1427
01:48:33,452 --> 01:48:36,952
My turn to play, Valentine.

1428
01:48:45,739 --> 01:48:47,852
Oh no. What the fuck is he...

1429
01:48:47,876 --> 01:48:49,876
I cant stop this.

1430
01:49:00,669 --> 01:49:02,669
ACTIVATE SECURITY IMPLANTS?

1431
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:04,333
Yes, please.

1432
01:49:06,052 --> 01:49:08,252
SECURITY IMPLANTS ACTIVATED

1433
01:49:08,276 --> 01:49:10,276
Nooo....

1434
01:50:07,744 --> 01:50:09,631
That was fucking spectacular.

1435
01:50:09,864 --> 01:50:12,202
Merlin, you're a fucking genius.

1436
01:50:12,666 --> 01:50:15,996
What the fuck is happening out there?

1437
01:50:20,263 --> 01:50:22,292
Aren't you that princess
who went missing?

1438
01:50:22,317 --> 01:50:23,354
Can you get me out?

1439
01:50:23,552 --> 01:50:25,302
Well if I do, will
you give me a kiss?

1440
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:27,076
I've always wanted
to kiss a princess.

1441
01:50:27,153 --> 01:50:29,793
If you get me out right now,
I will give you more than just a kiss.

1442
01:50:31,344 --> 01:50:32,651
You motherfucker.

1443
01:50:32,752 --> 01:50:34,545
<i>Did you really I
was stupid enough</i>

1444
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:36,976
<i>to implant one of those
things in my own head?</i>

1445
01:50:37,252 --> 01:50:38,952
<i>What are you? Fucking crazy?</i>

1446
01:50:39,952 --> 01:50:42,452
All those innocent people
killed and for what?

1447
01:50:43,152 --> 01:50:45,852
You didn't stop shit.

1448
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:49,355
Fine, I have locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

1449
01:50:49,363 --> 01:50:52,776
As I said, put your daughter in the
bathroom and throw away the key.

1450
01:50:52,952 --> 01:50:55,102
It's still happening.

1451
01:50:55,706 --> 01:50:58,129
- You fucking insane?
<i>- Just do it</i>.

1452
01:51:25,252 --> 01:51:27,094
Eggsy, the signal's started.

1453
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:30,276
Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now.

1454
01:51:30,452 --> 01:51:32,952
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

1455
01:51:33,052 --> 01:51:36,538
If you save the world,
would you do me in the asshole?

1456
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:39,587
I will be right back.

1457
01:51:41,052 --> 01:51:42,174
Good luck.

1458
01:51:48,752 --> 01:51:50,070
London.

1459
01:52:18,201 --> 01:52:19,344
Rio.

1460
01:52:35,122 --> 01:52:36,252
Get down.

1461
01:52:37,952 --> 01:52:39,152
You did it.

1462
01:52:48,352 --> 01:52:50,389
This glass is not gonna hold long.

1463
01:52:52,052 --> 01:52:53,676
You stay here.

1464
01:52:55,752 --> 01:52:58,741
- Merlin, quickly how do I get up there?
- Keep shooting. I'm find a route.

1465
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:00,690
Understood.

1466
01:53:35,852 --> 01:53:38,852
We are back up.

1467
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:47,652
This is great.

1468
01:53:55,905 --> 01:53:58,025
Eggsy, fucking get on with it.

1469
01:53:58,633 --> 01:54:00,133
Kick his ass, darling.

1470
01:54:06,352 --> 01:54:09,052
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai.

1471
01:54:17,581 --> 01:54:19,581
Kill that motherfucking...

1472
01:54:36,681 --> 01:54:39,228
Eggsy, the world is going to shit.

1473
01:54:48,852 --> 01:54:50,952
- Is he dead yet?
- Not yet.

1474
01:54:51,052 --> 01:54:53,752
Stop playing with your foot. Kill him.

1475
01:56:12,452 --> 01:56:13,652
Gazelle.

1476
01:56:13,676 --> 01:56:15,676
Gazelle!

1477
01:56:26,652 --> 01:56:28,652
<i>Come on.</i>

1478
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:32,356
<i>Kill him.</i>

1479
01:57:15,352 --> 01:57:16,852
<i>Well done son.</i>

1480
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:19,142
Yes!

1481
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:20,080
Yes! Eggsy

1482
01:57:20,352 --> 01:57:21,960
Well done, Eggsy.

1483
01:57:21,985 --> 01:57:23,876
And you, Lancelot.

1484
01:57:26,252 --> 01:57:29,730
I am sorry. Mommy
would never hurt you.

1485
01:57:29,755 --> 01:57:32,276
Mommy would never hurt you.
I am so sorry.

1486
01:57:35,127 --> 01:57:36,252
You okay?

1487
01:57:39,952 --> 01:57:41,952
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

1488
01:57:43,152 --> 01:57:44,352
He was right.

1489
01:57:59,951 --> 01:58:01,746
'Sup man?

1490
01:58:01,847 --> 01:58:05,552
Is this the part where you say some
really bad pun?

1491
01:58:06,352 --> 01:58:08,254
Its like you said to Harry:

1492
01:58:11,515 --> 01:58:13,715
This ain't that kind of movie, bro.

1493
01:58:15,352 --> 01:58:16,552
Perfect.

1494
01:58:37,352 --> 01:58:38,299
Eggsy, where you going?

1495
01:58:38,324 --> 01:58:40,876
There's no need for champagne
We have got lots on the plane.

1496
01:58:48,052 --> 01:58:50,041
Did you save the world?

1497
01:58:50,066 --> 01:58:51,276
Yes I did.

1498
01:58:54,047 --> 01:58:56,178
So, You gonna come in?

1499
01:58:56,203 --> 01:58:57,623
Yes, I am.

1500
01:59:02,738 --> 01:59:05,032
Merlin, this cell's locked.
How do I get in?

1501
01:59:07,352 --> 01:59:08,946
<i>26-25.</i>

1502
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:16,002
Merlin, you're the governor.

1503
01:59:17,874 --> 01:59:20,257
<i>You owe me, Eggsy.</i>

1504
01:59:26,269 --> 01:59:28,269
Eggsy

1505
01:59:32,876 --> 01:59:34,782
Oh my word.

1506
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:24,765
Michelle, turn that shit off, its
turning me nutty.

1507
02:00:25,603 --> 02:00:27,448
I rather like that song.

1508
02:00:27,591 --> 02:00:29,512
Leave it on eh, Mom.

1509
02:00:32,895 --> 02:00:34,917
Mugsy's back.

1510
02:00:35,224 --> 02:00:37,464
You finally come to have that
word with me, have you son?

1511
02:00:37,879 --> 02:00:39,520
Or are you going to run
away again and pretend

1512
02:00:39,545 --> 02:00:41,115
you're getting another
coat dress like that?

1513
02:00:41,191 --> 02:00:43,191
You mean this?

1514
02:00:44,133 --> 02:00:45,784
No.

1515
02:00:46,131 --> 02:00:49,477
I know this bloke who's just taken
over a tailor shop up on Seville Road.

1516
02:00:49,838 --> 02:00:51,838
He's got me a job, Mom.

1517
02:00:52,612 --> 02:00:54,612
Comes with a lot of perks.

1518
02:00:55,252 --> 02:00:57,252
Including a house.

1519
02:00:58,058 --> 02:01:00,058
Come and live with me there, Mum.

1520
02:01:00,689 --> 02:01:02,689
- Come on.
- Sit down, you.

1521
02:01:03,614 --> 02:01:06,865
Only place she'll be visiting is
you in fucking hospital, do you hear?

1522
02:01:06,965 --> 02:01:10,428
Just leave him alone.
Eggsy, go please. Just go away.

1523
02:01:11,589 --> 02:01:13,085
All right

1524
02:01:13,288 --> 02:01:14,910
Yes, just do as mommy says.

1525
02:01:15,011 --> 02:01:17,155
Why don't you ask that tailor
friend of yours to knock up

1526
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,206
a nice chicken costume,
it would suit you ya mug.

1527
02:01:22,141 --> 02:01:24,607
As a good friend once said:

1528
02:01:25,864 --> 02:01:27,203
Manners...

1529
02:01:28,707 --> 02:01:29,988
maketh...

1530
02:01:32,748 --> 02:01:34,429
man.

1531
02:01:34,771 --> 02:01:36,656
- Dean?
- Shut the fuck up.

1532
02:01:36,842 --> 02:01:39,195
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove your manners
up your fucking...

1533
02:01:44,371 --> 02:01:46,266
So...

1534
02:01:46,291 --> 02:01:50,655
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?
