@Subscene

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,267
Elegio reservations.
How may I help you?

3
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:05,836
Yes, I'd like to make a reservation for tonight,
 please.

4
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:07,872
I'm sorry.
We're booked months in advance.

5
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:11,743
Okay, I understand.
Thank you very much.

6
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:22,084
Elegio reservations.
How may I help you?

7
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,585
Order.

8
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,154
That ready?
Yeah.

9
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:26,757
Thanks.

10
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,630
He knows the town better than anybody.

11
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,266
Right.

12
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,550
There's another place we can go.
Yeah, he'll be here.

13
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:06,891
Okay, yeah, you--
Look, you know what?

14
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,361
He's right there.
That's my friend.

15
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:14,197
Will you be my boyfriend--
Just for a minute?

16
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:18,167
You're not a... serial killer, are you?

17
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,335
That depends.

18
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:22,071
How many times does it take to get to serial?

19
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,339
Five?

20
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,042
No, we're good.

21
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:29,578
Jess.

22
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,113
Nicky.

23
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:34,648
Burgundy.

24
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:35,917
Very good.

25
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,285
It's very confusing, isn't it?

26
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,555
How do you know it all?

27
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:44,223
Mostly from drinking.

28
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,994
Yeah. The more you drink,
the more you learn.

29
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:49,328
In that case, I am, -

30
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,731
I am the foremost expert in jager bombs.

31
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,133
I will walk you through it all.

32
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,871
It's been a pleasure to serve you, chef oshowole.

33
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,606
Chef who?

34
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:05,877
Oshowole.

35
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,112
Yeah.

36
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:10,547
You know, it may be the roofies talking,

37
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:11,816
but this is really fun.

38
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:14,851
Thank you.

39
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:20,022
Thank you for rescuing me.

40
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,324
Yeah.

41
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,759
We showed him.
Yeah.

42
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,394
Got to respect him, though--
He left it all on the field.

43
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,061
That's what I'm missing out on tonight?

44
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:28,963
Yeah.
Wow. Shit.

45
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,399
Can I walk you somewhere?

46
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,167
Actually, I'm...
I'm staying here...

47
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:36,704
Upstairs.

48
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:39,573
Really?

49
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,657
My God.
It's my husband.

50
00:03:58,658 --> 00:03:59,924
Shut the fuck up!
Jared, wait.

51
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,358
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

52
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,060
I'll fuckin' kill you!
Jared, just let him go.

53
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:04,595
No fuckin' way.
He's fuckin' dead.

54
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:07,199
Give me one fuckin' reason why I shouldn't do it.

55
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,601
I'm drawing a blank.
What?

56
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:12,835
I think you should shoot me.

57
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,504
Let's be honest, you've been aggrieved.

58
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,773
Don't mess around with him, Nicky.
He's done hard time.

59
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,673
I've done fuckin' hard time.

60
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:22,811
- If you had any idea what I was about to do to her--
- Shut up, man.

61
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,346
She was gonna be no good to you after that,

62
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,747
so, you should really shoot me.

63
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,081
What the fuck?

64
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:28,615
What kind of stuff are we talking about?

65
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,818
Saudi bachelor-party shit.

66
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,720
Saudi bachelor party?

67
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,588
R. Kelly drop-cloth shit.

68
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,756
Please, come on, shoot me.

69
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,058
Would you stop fucking around?

70
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,292
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

71
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:40,860
You'd really be doing me a favor.

72
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:44,396
Cancer.
Tumor the size of a peach.

73
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,299
Pull the trigger.
You'll see.

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,766
Y-you got cancer?

75
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,234
He's onto us.

76
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,403
Aw, shit!
 I knew this wasn't gonna fuckin' work!

77
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,505
You guys suck.

78
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:53,838
Just give us the money.

79
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,107
Or what?

80
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,374
Or he's gonna shoot you in the neck.

81
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,509
I don't want to shoot a guy with cancer.

82
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,176
Grandma mukulski had cancer.

83
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:00,712
He doesn't have cancer, you idiot!

84
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:02,346
You guys really boned this thing.

85
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,980
First of all, you got to wait till she gets my pants off.

86
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,016
And then you got to give me a chance to run.

87
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,117
That's how you get the money.

88
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:09,286
And you never drop the con.

89
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,388
You never break.
Die with the lie.

90
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,223
When did you make us?

91
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,392
When you stole the wallet from the bum downstairs.

92
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:17,826
Bullshit.

93
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,929
No, real shit.

94
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,197
Then why'd you come up here if you're so smart?

95
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,965
Professional curiosity.

96
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,267
And I like boobs.

97
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,103
You know, I figured it was a win-win.

98
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,171
All thumbs, sweetheart.
It was a bum lift.

99
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,640
It was a great lift.

100
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,642
Please, he was so shithoused,
you could've taken his appendix.

101
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:36,945
You suck!

102
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:41,981
You really should be more aware.

103
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:43,717
I've been behind you for two blocks.

104
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,085
You didn't see me?

105
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:47,219
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

106
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Well, if you're gonna play this game,

107
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,989
you might want to grow a pair.

108
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,325
I can take care of myself.

109
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:56,527
No, you're gonna get hurt.

110
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,662
Let me buy you a coffee.

111
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,598
I don't drink coffee.

112
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,633
Fine.

113
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,803
Fine.

114
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,638
So, what's your thing?

115
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,940
Inside? Roper?

116
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,341
You can tell me.

117
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:13,943
Everything--
Been in this game so long.

118
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:15,811
I want to "Cannon."
That's what I want to do.

119
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,112
Really?

120
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:19,281
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

121
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:24,252
My grandfather used to run a crooked game in Harlem.

122
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:27,221
Eventually, my father started shilling for him.

123
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,224
And, one day, they get burned.

124
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,426
Mobbed-up guy catches them throwing signals.

125
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:37,164
Everybody's guns come out--
Standoff.

126
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:42,535
No way out except one--
"the Toledo panic button."

127
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,936
What the hell is that?

128
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,238
You shoot your partner--
It proves you're not together.

129
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,841
You kill your partner?

130
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,842
But you hope you don't.

131
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,778
Does it work?

132
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,615
He's 0 for 3.

133
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,217
So your father killed your grandfather?

134
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:02,686
That's the world you're in.

135
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,455
Dabblers get killed.

136
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:07,324
Look, I wasn't born into this like you.

137
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,859
I-I was a dyslexic foster kid--

138
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,327
No prospects, no future.

139
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,796
I mean, it's a minor miracle I'm not a hooker right now.

140
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:14,998
Tutor me.
No.

141
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,999
Why not?
I'm headed out of town.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,268
Well, wait, look, I can pay you--
If that helps.

143
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,870
Whose wallet is that?

144
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:24,040
"Dr. Peter woshilak."

145
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:29,910
We're gonna make this quick 'cause it's really cold.

146
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,080
Now, I'm gonna show you a few touches,

147
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:37,118
but at the end of the day, this is a game of focus.

148
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,521
That's very clever.

149
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:44,090
All right, now, attention is like a spotlight.

150
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:48,394
And our job is to dance in the darkness.

151
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:51,831
I didn't even feel you take that.

152
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:56,033
The human brain is slow, and it cannot multitask.

153
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,436
Jesus! When...

154
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,271
All right, I'm sure you can flip a leather on its feet,

155
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,274
but what we're talking about
is much more complex than that.

156
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,076
When did you...
Take my wallet?

157
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,545
You take zumba?
Well, it's actually

158
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:11,113
a really good cardio workout, thank you very much.

159
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,449
You're thinking with your hands.

160
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,785
All right, you got to get inside the Vic's head,

161
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,486
perceive from their perspective.

162
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,721
Human behavior is very predictable.

163
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:20,956
If I look at my hand,

164
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,491
it naturally pulls your gaze

165
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,792
and allows me to enter your space.

166
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:26,461
But when I look up at you,

167
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,463
it causes you to look directly at me.

168
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,435
Cute.

169
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:36,936
I touch you here, I steal from here.

170
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:39,506
I tap you here, I steal from here.

171
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:42,708
I step to here-- you're not
gonna slap my face, are you?

172
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,311
Why?

173
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:46,979
You would if you knew where my hand was.

174
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,254
Okay, I get it, I get it.

175
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,055
You get their focus...

176
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:01,293
You can take whatever you want.

177
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,732
You be safe.

178
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:43,129
So, why do I like this place?

179
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,633
Lots of space.
Doesn't open for a month or two.

180
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:50,401
We can tie into multiple lines, diffuse our footprint,

181
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,372
keep hopping dns addresses,
plus military-grade fiber.

182
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,607
How many bathrooms?
Fat ass Farhad is flying in.

183
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,976
Two-- coed.
He still got irritable bowel?

184
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:01,078
Yep.

185
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,346
Man, he should do a cleanse.

186
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:06,082
Horst, he is a 400-pound persian.

187
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,017
He is not gonna do a cleanse.

188
00:10:08,018 --> 00:10:09,919
Where you been staying, Hyatt again?

189
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,054
Yep. I love the brunch.

190
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:13,589
You should stop by.

191
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,591
No, no brunch.
I'm doing a cleanse.

192
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,026
The horses are at the gate.

193
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,862
And they're off!

194
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:49,455
Hyatt rewards card in my wallet.

195
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,622
Admit that you're impressed.
I got your wallet,

196
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,291
and I found you all the way down here.

197
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,561
Please.
World series, final four,

198
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,630
the sugar bowl, super bowl--

199
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,797
Any big event like this is sucker central.

200
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,799
Well, I still found you. That's
got to count for something.

201
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,435
So, how many Hyatts did you have to go to?

202
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,104
All three, five times each.

203
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,839
I want in.

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,508
Maybe I'm just here to watch the game.

205
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:15,044
I asked around who ran the game in Harlem.

206
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,312
"The limehouse kid" is your grandfather.

207
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:19,180
Bucky spurgeon is your father.

208
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:20,782
"Father" is a very generous term.

209
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:23,318
And you're Nicky spurgeon.
They call you "mellow."

210
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,652
I'm all crewed up, sweetie.

211
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:26,120
Come on.

212
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,021
Plea-- can we--
Can we just...

213
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,256
Can we skip the part

214
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,858
where I speak through thinly veiled allure

215
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,260
and lead you to believe

216
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,861
there's some earth-shattering hump in the works?

217
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,897
'Cause I suck at that kind of stuff.
I just want in.

218
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,666
There's no earth-shattering hump in the works?

219
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,068
No.
I don't even get thinly veiled allure?

220
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,403
No.

221
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,005
No baby voice?
No lingering eye contact?

222
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,540
I am hopeless.

223
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,242
That's all my favorite shit.

224
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,510
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,977
Can I suggest that you learn--

226
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,146
Professionally?

227
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:59,316
Well, I mean, you could...

228
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,852
You could show me...

229
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:04,489
In your room.

230
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,691
That is so bad.
Is it?

231
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,260
Does it feel sexy on your face?

232
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,162
A little.
It does? Okay, let's go.

233
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,264
Wa-- wait. Where are go--
Wait. Am I in?

234
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:16,865
No. This is Horst.

235
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,100
Hello, Jess.
Hi.

236
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:20,101
Nicky told me you were coming.

237
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:23,271
You're such a dick!

238
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:26,407
Yeah, he gets that a lot.
Let's go.

239
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:28,275
What are you, a size four?

240
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,076
Why do I have to wear this?

241
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:33,180
No one looks at your hands when
you got that working for you.

242
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:34,714
I can't breathe.

243
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:36,616
First things first--
We stick to rich folks

244
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:37,851
and no one with a cane or a wheelchair.

245
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:38,951
It's bad luck.

246
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,620
Tommy's the shade, gareth's the stick.

247
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:42,288
All eyes on me until I make the mark,

248
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:43,722
and once I fan them, I tug my lapel.

249
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,324
Two fingers means it's a prat poke.

250
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:47,193
Three fingers means the leather's an insider.

251
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:48,593
If it's a "cordeen" or an ox tongue,

252
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:50,228
I'll scratch my nose, unless I use my thumb,

253
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,430
which means that I am actually scratching my nose.

254
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:54,131
Anything in the left tail or the right tail,

255
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,866
I'll cock my head, but nowadays
"keister kicks" are 95% of it.

256
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,201
So you just do the touch,

257
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:59,936
and I ding the "poke" in the nearest mailbox, okay?

258
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:01,838
I'm sorry, what?

259
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,976
Okay, plan "B."
You two come with me.

260
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:28,062
Excuse me.
I'm so lost.

261
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,334
It was excellent.
You want to wire?

262
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,635
Let me wire.

263
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:37,137
Ponytail's your mark--
Right bridge.

264
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,338
Right-rear pocket.

265
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,143
My bad.
Come on, y'all!

266
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:48,447
That was nice.
Okay, I got this.

267
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:49,981
What?
Gimme some shade.

268
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:52,417
W-wait.

269
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:20,441
My heel keeps--
You're such a gentleman.

270
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,676
Thank you, sir.

271
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,678
Derrick knows how to treat a lady.

272
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,479
Married?

273
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,745
Dude! Come on!

274
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:26,946
Didn't mention that, did he?

275
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:27,847
No.
All right.

276
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:29,216
Thank you, boys.

277
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,857
You're in.

278
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:38,891
Really?!

279
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,959
Congratulations.
You're a criminal.

280
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,060
Okay, what now?

281
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,228
Want me to do the primer?

282
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:44,529
I got it.
Primer?

283
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,197
There's a flight landing every two minutes

284
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:47,632
at Louis Armstrong.

285
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,368
Whoever's not here for the game is here for the party.

286
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,003
Every one of them looking to drink big, bet big,

287
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,773
cheat on their spouses, and it all costs money.

288
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:58,909
There are boost teams at all the major hotels.

289
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,444
They hit quick and get out

290
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:02,912
before anybody ever knows what happened.

291
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,515
And if you think for one second I'm gonna let your mother

292
00:15:05,516 --> 00:15:07,550
talk to me like that, you are fuckin' crazy!

293
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,151
I'm a grown-ass man!

294
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:11,753
Why are you yelling at me?

295
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:14,389
There's card games everywhere,

296
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,157
and they let anyone with enough cash in.

297
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:18,760
Chances are, at least one of those guys you don't know

298
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:20,528
is a mechanic who can work a deck

299
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,464
like Bill Clinton works a crowd.

300
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,501
All in.

301
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,235
Full boat.

302
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:31,905
I swear...

303
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:35,008
I've never had four of a kind before.

304
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,543
Ha! Sorry, coach.

305
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,510
I've never had four of a ki--
Hey, come on, coach.

306
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:41,780
Motherfucker! What the fuck?!
You win some, you lose some, right?

307
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:43,649
That's it.
Get the fuck out of here.

308
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,482
Come on.
Let's go. Move.

309
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,351
Whoo!
Yeah.

310
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:48,686
Um, it's my husband.
I'm-a kill you!

311
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,522
Give me my pants! Come here!
No! No just run!

312
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:51,757
Wait! Wait!
You little bitch!

313
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:59,462
Married guys are the best.

314
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:01,264
Who they gonna tell?

315
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:02,866
I'm gonna kill you!

316
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,233
It's my husband!

317
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,534
Every minute,

318
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,603
there's something going on down here--

319
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,905
Every bar, restaurant, hotel, everywhere.

320
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:12,040
Guys working alone, working in teams--

321
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,374
Not just cash, either.

322
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,178
Identity theft and credit-card
spoofing are big, too.

323
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,815
You can skim the data right off
a credit card in about a second.

324
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,217
But boosting a wallet only gives you an hour

325
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,286
before the Vic gets wise and the cards are canceled.

326
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,922
So you put the card back.

327
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:30,624
By the time the mark gets wise,

328
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,825
he's in youngstown arguing with his wife

329
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,596
over the charges we rack up before the bill comes.

330
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,701
A skimmer swipes the card and records the keystrokes

331
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,369
so you can get the pin, too.

332
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,604
Look. You see that?

333
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,572
Wow.

334
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,773
Did he make that?

335
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,274
Yeah.

336
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,508
A few years back,

337
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,411
he replaced the credit-card terminals

338
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,746
at about a dozen 99 cents stores in L.A.--

339
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:58,214
Took down a few million before they caught on.

340
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:00,250
What does a guy like that do with that kind of money?

341
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:04,989
He, financed his own line of gravies.

342
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,326
Yeah, he just--
That's his seat.

343
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:12,761
Just let him...

344
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:14,629
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
Okay. Yeah.

345
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,934
Who's the girl?

346
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,904
Her name is Jess, Farhad.
She's our intern.

347
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,208
You hitting that?

348
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:29,943
I'm... Right here.

349
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:33,180
No, Farhad, I'm not hitting that.
You should hit that.

350
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:35,549
Yeah, hi.
Still right here.

351
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,285
I'd totally hit that.

352
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:43,054
He's fucking with me, right?

353
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:45,056
Right?

354
00:17:45,057 --> 00:17:46,357
She talks a lot.

355
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,759
Smile.

356
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,160
Thank you.

357
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,829
I'll get this loaded in.
It shouldn't take too long.

358
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,063
Get a digital camera.
So, we're about 30 strong.

359
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,631
Everybody gets a percentage.

360
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:56,066
We cover bribes and fall money

361
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,336
for anybody who gets pinched--
Knock wood.

362
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:02,004
We sell the atm data to a guy in Singapore.

363
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:04,007
The shopaholics here buy merchandise,

364
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,974
which we overnight back to ourselves

365
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,743
and resell on the gray market.

366
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:10,712
Yesterday, we bought 200 macbook airs.

367
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:14,316
My God.
That is incredible.

368
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:18,053
- Do you-- do you think that maybe--
- No.

369
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:20,821
We-- sell everything.
Take no chances.

370
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:23,957
So, what about the big con?

371
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:27,994
I thought you were all big time?

372
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:30,263
You mean the one where we make so much money

373
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:33,733
we all retire and get yachts and boob jobs?

374
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,334
Yeah, that's a fantasy.

375
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:39,105
We are in the volume business.
Safer that way.

376
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:44,710
Hey, Jen, I need a dime.
I got bit at the track.

377
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,511
Come on, girl.

378
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:49,081
Thank you, baby.

379
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,396
Clean card, clean I.D.--

380
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,665
Everything you need.

381
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,001
Thank you.

382
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:53,704
Well, don't thank me yet.

383
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:56,307
Got a lot of work to do.

384
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,075
Tough week ahead.
I know.

385
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,814
So, what now?

386
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:07,816
There's a key card in there.

387
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:11,320
I got you another place.

388
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,221
I think you'll like it.

389
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:15,889
Wow. Thanks.

390
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,828
Do you know how I can get a cab there?

391
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:31,638
I can give you a ride.

392
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:33,672
Yeah?
That'd be great.

393
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,108
I mean, if it's okay with you.

394
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,179
It's fine with me.
Is it okay with you?

395
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,080
Yeah.

396
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,148
You sure?

397
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:47,184
You seem like a pretty good driver.

398
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:50,021
You can count on me.

399
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:52,523
Can I?

400
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:54,991
Most would say no.

401
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:58,997
You seem trustworthy.

402
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,037
Maybe you should take that cab.

403
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,208
Yeah.

404
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,845
Okay.

405
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,720
Aww. Who's that?

406
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:07,356
This is my little girl, Mina.

407
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:08,390
Cute.

408
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:09,592
My son, Dani.

409
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:10,691
Aww. Sweet.

410
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:12,693
That's my wife, Lida.

411
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:13,894
Pretty.

412
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:15,697
That's my dick.

413
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,798
Cool.

414
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,466
Sorry about that.
That's okay.

415
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:19,833
That's my dog.

416
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,035
Aww.
Hate it.

417
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:25,372
So, you've known, um--
You've known Nicky a long time?

418
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:27,407
10 years. Why?

419
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,575
I was just wondering.

420
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:33,012
Okay, you got me.
We're sleeping together, okay?

421
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:34,846
Like the ancient greeks.

422
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,915
Actually, I don't know.

423
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,650
I mean, I like the guy, I do,

424
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,886
but people aren't really his bag,

425
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:42,854
so it's hard to tell sometimes.

426
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:44,255
Yeah, I guess you can't blame him.

427
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:45,890
I mean, he told me about that thing

428
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:47,691
with his dad and his grandfather.

429
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,860
That's-- that's crazy.

430
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:52,529
He told you that?

431
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,565
I mean, I've heard that story, but never from him.

432
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,500
Really?

433
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,903
You must throw a mean one.

434
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:01,270
Damn.
Ha ha.

435
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm really gonna miss sucking his dick.

436
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:07,542
So is he.

437
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:10,479
Stop it.

438
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,547
All right. You ready?

439
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,849
Yep.

440
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,316
Frank! Frank!
My God!

441
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:18,619
Somebody help!
Please, please, somebody help!

442
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:24,557
Somebody get someone!
Somebody call a doctor!

443
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:28,662
I need a doctor.
Doctor, help me.

444
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:29,930
My husband's just had a heart attack.

445
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:31,697
I don't know what to do.
I'm so worried.

446
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,904
Frank!

447
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:41,806
Who was the cop with the wandering hands?

448
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:44,609
He was real.

449
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,310
He just stumbled in.

450
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,012
Who hits on a grieving widow?

451
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:50,880
I guess that's just how fantastic

452
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,815
you look in that dress.

453
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,318
What's a girl to do?

454
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,120
I can think of a couple things she could do.

455
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:59,288
Yeah, me too, actually.

456
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,891
I think we should start with oral.

457
00:24:01,892 --> 00:24:03,425
Just saying.

458
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:04,727
Come on, man.
I'm right here.

459
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:05,795
Sorry.
Sorry.

460
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:07,729
Everybody.

461
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,030
That's so incredibly profound.

462
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,731
Everybody, everybody, everybody!

463
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:11,901
Can I get your attention?

464
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,970
What you laughing at?

465
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:18,873
A record-setting week.

466
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,842
And I want to say congratulations to you all.

467
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:25,546
After expenses--
$1.2 million.

468
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:30,950
Great work, great work.

469
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,285
After the big game's over tomorrow,

470
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:33,918
this place is gonna get bleached down.

471
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:34,953
Anything's not nailed to the floor

472
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,287
is going in the incinerator.

473
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,390
Horst here has all of your travel money.

474
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,992
Once you get home, I will wire you all your cuts.

475
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:43,794
Thank you, guys, really.

476
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,362
To Nicky!

477
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:46,798
To Nicky!

478
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:14,889
No, no, Farhad, not forehead.

479
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,023
What's that mean?

480
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,859
It doesn't matter.

481
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,527
Stay juicy.

482
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:27,000
That's all of it?
1.2?

483
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,767
Do not let it leave your sight.

484
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:29,968
You promise?

485
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:31,103
Yeah, I promise.

486
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:32,337
No dogs or ponies, right?

487
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:34,373
Hey.
How long have you known me?

488
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:37,475
No, just look. Look at me.
Man to man.

489
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:38,776
No gambling, okay?

490
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:40,011
Yes, dear.

491
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:43,049
I'll see you when I see you.

492
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:49,020
You guys are so cute.

493
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:54,057
I'm tired.

494
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:57,126
Okay. You want to go the game tomorrow?

495
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,861
You have tickets?

496
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:00,496
Of course.

497
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:02,465
That's one of the perks of the business.

498
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:06,401
Do you mean...
These tickets?

499
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:09,538
Okay, you're gonna need to stop that, all right?

500
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,673
Stop showing off.

501
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,709
An exit interview?

502
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,811
Yes.

503
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:18,579
My God.
Are you seri--

504
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,847
Tell me.

505
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:22,482
So you mean like,
"Jess is a hard worker--

506
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:23,550
Honest and prompt.

507
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:25,151
I believe she'll be a valuable asset

508
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,220
to your team at sizzler of San Bernardino.

509
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,388
No, not a reference, you dick!

510
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,592
Criticism, constructive criticism.

511
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,296
R-really?

512
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,598
Are you serious?

513
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,535
Yes.

514
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,605
Okay.

515
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,073
Okay.

516
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,244
Got a light touch.

517
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:59,881
You know, you're kind of invisible out there.

518
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:01,316
And you're calm.

519
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:04,053
You know, you get upside down, you don't panic.

520
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,387
You adjust.

521
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:10,958
You actually rally when the going gets tough.

522
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,627
Which is rare.

523
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:14,895
And I been in this for...

524
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:20,467
A really, really long time.

525
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:23,505
And I've never seen anything like you.

526
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,375
Thank you.

527
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:33,444
But I was actually talking about the sex.

528
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,546
Aw, please, there's a thousand better than you.

529
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,248
Whoa! Please!

530
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:39,017
I can't believe you said that!

531
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:40,418
Yeah, you're just laying there, you know?

532
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:42,520
I'm like, "come on, is this thing on?"

533
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:45,756
You're mean.

534
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:50,627
Why mellow?

535
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,228
What?

536
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:53,796
Why do they call you mellow?

537
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:58,400
Yeah, I don't-- no.
I don't like that name.

538
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:02,304
I know, but why do they call you that?

539
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:07,476
My dad just started calling me that.

540
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,942
And...

541
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:11,447
And I don't like it.

542
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:25,358
My dad, he said, um...

543
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,160
"There's two kinds of people in this world.

544
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:33,532
There's hammers and nails.

545
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,301
You decide which one you want to be."

546
00:28:36,302 --> 00:28:41,138
He said, "there's no room for heart in this game.

547
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:43,974
That shit'll get you killed."

548
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:47,410
He--
He said I was soft.

549
00:28:47,411 --> 00:28:51,081
So he started calling me "marshmallow."

550
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:53,016
Mellow.

551
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:55,219
Yeah.

552
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:00,623
You're a big old marshmallow, you are.

553
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:02,091
Mnh-Mnh.

554
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,662
I'm gonna get some more wine.
Do you want some?

555
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,397
Nope. I'm good.

556
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:10,566
Okay.

557
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,481
How did you get these tickets?

558
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:11,152
That's one of the many wonderful things about being me.

559
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:14,421
...MVP with Chicago.

560
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:18,126
Let's give a superdome welcome to Billy Canady!

561
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:27,500
Is this a bad time to mention
I don't really like football?

562
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:29,902
Yeah.

563
00:30:29,903 --> 00:30:31,737
Like, the worst time possible.

564
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:34,806
I'm sorry.

565
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:37,208
It just seems like a lot of standing around all the time.

566
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:40,278
Are you kidding?
Don't you think? Like...

567
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,180
Well, you were really excited about the tickets.

568
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,449
No, I am.
I'm so excited.

569
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,817
I just--
I don't get the game.

570
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,120
I get it. All right.

571
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,253
You know what?
Forget football.

572
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:54,090
We can still have fun.
All right.

573
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:57,026
- Get your hot dogs right here!
- Um...

574
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:59,160
Right there.

575
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,795
I will bet you one dollar

576
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:03,298
that that guy does not catch that hot dog.

577
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,033
Down there?
Yep.

578
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:06,269
Okay.

579
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,272
How did you know that?

580
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:13,340
Because that guy cannot throw.

581
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:15,242
He knocked this old lady's glasses off

582
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:16,375
about 10 minutes ago.

583
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,678
Okay, okay.

584
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,915
Okay, um...
Whoo!

585
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,651
Down there-- shirtless guy with the body paint.

586
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:27,085
$10 says he's too drunk to get up for the wave.

587
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,654
Are you sure?
His team is on a drive.

588
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,522
Are you in or out?
I'm in.

589
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:31,725
Okay.

590
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,827
Don't do it.

591
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:39,897
Yes!

592
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,499
Really?
Really?

593
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,867
I know my drunks.

594
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,900
So, you're a fan?

595
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,336
You're considering yourself a fan?

596
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,204
Thank you.

597
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:49,506
Okay, we're even now.

598
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,007
All right, hold on.
No, no, a tiebreaker.

599
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,040
Okay.

600
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,976
Um... Okay.

601
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,078
Mamita with the short shorts.
Yeah.

602
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,779
See?
Yeah.

603
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,815
How many guys are gonna look at her ass

604
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:00,915
as she walks up the aisle?

605
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,049
Closest one wins.

606
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,251
End seats only?

607
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:05,519
End seats only.
At least eight.

608
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,221
Eight?

609
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:09,858
Three.
Five.

610
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,592
Can I get in on this?

611
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:15,963
Sure.
10 bucks, Mr...

612
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,998
Liyuan.
I say five guys look.

613
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,398
Sure thing.

614
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,167
Okay.

615
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:22,268
There's one.

616
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:24,137
Two.
Yeah.

617
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:25,338
Three.

618
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:26,372
Four, sorry.

619
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:27,273
I'm out. I'm done.

620
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,707
Five.

621
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,142
And it's six.
Come on, come on.

622
00:32:31,143 --> 00:32:32,979
Six.

623
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,047
Seven! Yes!

624
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,181
I'm the closest.

625
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:39,816
I know my leches, too.

626
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:42,419
Money, money, money.

627
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,988
Okay, okay.

628
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:46,555
I want justice.
I want my money back.

629
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,458
Make another back.
Okay.

630
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:49,792
I want my change.

631
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,494
Pbht!

632
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:53,330
Okay, which team draws next penalty?

633
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:56,098
I don't know football.
You boys play.

634
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,933
Okay. Defense.

635
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,668
How much?

636
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,069
First down, rhinos.

637
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,604
$1,000.

638
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,839
Ooh.

639
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:11,011
Yeah.

640
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:14,281
I'll do the thousand.

641
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:17,552
Hut, hut!

642
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:25,458
We have holding--
Number 77 on the offense.

643
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:26,625
10-yard penalty.

644
00:33:26,626 --> 00:33:27,959
Yes!

645
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,994
Okay, $5,000.

646
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,928
Do they pass or run?

647
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:31,896
$5,000?

648
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:33,030
Wow.

649
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:34,966
He's been drinking, he's been drinking.

650
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,203
He's definitely been drinking.
I have.

651
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:40,470
Okay, you call it.

652
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:42,974
They run.
They run.

653
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:47,746
3-18! Hut!

654
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,482
Yeah!
They run, they run!

655
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:54,750
Yeah!

656
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:55,852
Ooh. Ouch.

657
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:57,886
Yeah, ouch is right.
Ouch.

658
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:59,454
Ouch is right. Um...

659
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,023
On that note, I'm-a get a drink.

660
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:03,025
Yeah, me too.

661
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,560
Double or nothing--
Your bet.

662
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:06,794
No, I'm good. I'm good, man.
Thank you.

663
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,162
No, no, no, easy bet, easy bet!

664
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:10,664
They make this kick, you win.
Good odds?

665
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,566
They always make this kick.
You can't lose.

666
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,869
Come on, I want to play.

667
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,536
I like you.

668
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:19,674
You can't lose.

669
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:24,644
Come on, I want to play.

670
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:28,313
How much?

671
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:30,016
Double or nothing.
$10,000.

672
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,988
Too much?

673
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:41,826
All right. 10 grand.

674
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,031
3-42! Hut!

675
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,633
No.
Really?

676
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,335
I'm sorry.
Wow.

677
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:54,636
I'm sorry.
Wow.

678
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:58,140
I'm such a lucky guy.

679
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,742
Maybe we should--
Maybe we should just get going.

680
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:02,977
I'm gonna-- all right.

681
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:05,146
Wait. Hold-- hold up.

682
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:06,413
50.

683
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:08,316
Say again?

684
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,416
50 grand.

685
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:10,717
Nicky.

686
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:11,718
It's all right, it's all right, okay?

687
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,721
Okay.
Relax.

688
00:35:14,722 --> 00:35:16,423
Um, he's not gonna return the kick.

689
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:19,192
On the kickoff, he'll take a knee.

690
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,799
Now you make things interesting.

691
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,403
Okay.

692
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,017
Okay.

693
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:50,419
We good? Nicky?

694
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,054
Wow.
It's okay.

695
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:53,588
It's okay.

696
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:54,856
All right.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

697
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:56,291
All right.
Give me one second.

698
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:58,092
Give me a second, give me a second, give me a second.

699
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:00,596
Please.

700
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,603
A hundred grand.

701
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,370
$100,000?

702
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,272
Yep.

703
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:16,977
You don't have $100,000.

704
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,878
Yeah, I do.

705
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:23,449
You can't do that.

706
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,463
Next play--
Pass incomplete.

707
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,466
Well, I say he catches it.

708
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:06,020
Whaaa?

709
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:10,123
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

710
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:16,095
We're going.

711
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:17,396
We're going.

712
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:18,898
We're going.

713
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:29,308
All of it-- $1.1 million.

714
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:30,776
Nicky.

715
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:32,978
Nicky, that is my money, too.

716
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,179
High card takes it all.

717
00:37:51,327 --> 00:37:53,428
After you.

718
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,832
Thank you.

719
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:11,378
Tamade!

720
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:17,516
What was that you said?
"Tomo ha de"?

721
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:20,053
What's that?
It's just an expression.

722
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,290
It's hard to explain.

723
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:30,029
A rough translation is...

724
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:37,168
...I am fucked!

725
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,565
Hey!

726
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,616
Sorry, friend, that's what happens

727
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:33,050
when you play with the big boys.

728
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:42,325
Hey!

729
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,660
Fuck.

730
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:47,195
Double it.

731
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:48,597
Man.

732
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:49,798
Dude, what are you doing?

733
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:51,366
I'm good for it.

734
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,836
Double it.

735
00:39:53,837 --> 00:39:56,171
You got a problem, my friend.

736
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:57,305
Take those binoculars,

737
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,774
pick any player on or off the field,

738
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,011
and I will guess their number.

739
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:09,082
Any player?
That's like 100 to 1.

740
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:12,352
That's good odds for you.
$2 million.

741
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,853
That's fucking crazy.

742
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:17,590
I don't like it.

743
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:18,991
Okay, okay.

744
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:20,793
I'll sweeten it for you.

745
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,994
You pick the player...

746
00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:26,098
And she'll guess the number.

747
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,633
What?

748
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:37,641
You're fucking crazy,

749
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:41,777
but I can't turn down free money.

750
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:44,281
You got a bet.

751
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,988
Alvin.

752
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:55,123
What are you doing?

753
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:56,891
Don't-- don't drag me into this.
Stop it.

754
00:40:56,892 --> 00:40:59,493
What, it's not enough that you
lost everyone's money--

755
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:00,828
My money?

756
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:02,864
She sounds like my wife.

757
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:05,799
Get your hands off me.
You're sick!

758
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,168
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, wait, wait.

759
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:10,003
Hey, hey, don't put your hands on her.

760
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:12,372
Steven, stop, stop!
What the hell is your problem?

761
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:14,440
Tell him to keep his damn hands to himself.

762
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,575
I understand, I understand.
I am sorry.

763
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,043
He has gotten carried away.

764
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:19,911
He likes to pretend that he is the Kevin costner

765
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:21,079
and I am the Whitney Houston.

766
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,448
The hell?!
Steven.

767
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,316
Please, he just knows that I want to play.

768
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,920
Let's play.

769
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,356
Look at me. Hey.

770
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:32,824
Please don't make me do this.
Nicky, please.

771
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,791
Okay.

772
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,126
Just pick.

773
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,461
Don't make me do this.

774
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,229
Jess.
Just let me go.

775
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,631
Just do it.

776
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,366
Pick a fuckin' player.

777
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,934
Please don't make me do this.

778
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,569
Nicky, please. Please.

779
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,138
It's okay.

780
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,239
Okay.

781
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,908
I got one.

782
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:56,645
Do you want me to write it down?

783
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:58,380
Nah, I trust you.

784
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,981
Nicky.

785
00:42:00,982 --> 00:42:03,450
Then it's her turn.

786
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:05,185
Just do it.

787
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:06,620
Pick.

788
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:09,189
Pick a fuckin' player.

789
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,758
He's crazy, I know, but it will be his fault.

790
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:15,094
Not yours.

791
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:37,680
Let's do it, let's go!

792
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:40,418
Don't take a chance!
Fair catch if you have to!

793
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,753
Set up to run now!

794
00:42:43,754 --> 00:42:46,256
Um, um, I don't know.
I don't...

795
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:53,163
Look, I'll give you one chance to back down, okay?

796
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,967
No hard feelings.

797
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:03,404
Pick.

798
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,875
Wow.

799
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:16,917
I guess...

800
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:22,253
I guess number...

801
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:24,589
Wait.

802
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:42,104
Number 55.

803
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:51,079
No.

804
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,289
No, no, no, no, no.
No fucking way!

805
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:07,593
How did you do that?!
I'm right?

806
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:09,228
Am I right?
Fuck! Yes!

807
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,231
You're fucking right!
I'm right?

808
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,766
Fucking shit!
My God.

809
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,599
You're fucking right.
That is crazy.

810
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,801
You're not mad?

811
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:17,002
No fucking way!
No?

812
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:18,336
I'm not-- Mwah!-- Mad.

813
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:20,572
We have got to go to Vegas right now.

814
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:22,674
I have a jet.

815
00:44:22,675 --> 00:44:23,908
That was incredible!

816
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:25,910
Did you see what she just did?!

817
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:27,345
And you, you!

818
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:30,981
You have got some big fucking balls!

819
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:33,617
You are my new fucking hero.

820
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:34,984
Double or nothing?

821
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,253
Whoa! No fucking way!

822
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:40,257
Get the fuck out of my suite!
Now!

823
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:43,826
Yeah! First down, baby!
First down!

824
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:45,161
We're good! We're good!

825
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,996
We're good, coach.

826
00:44:46,997 --> 00:44:48,930
Consider your debt settled.

827
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,434
I am going to kill you.

828
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:54,869
Kill me later.

829
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:13,886
I'm going to kill you!

830
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:15,488
What?!

831
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:17,355
You did great, you did great, you did great.

832
00:45:17,356 --> 00:45:19,624
My God.

833
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,459
How did you do that?

834
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,495
Liyuan Tse--
Legendary gambler.

835
00:45:24,496 --> 00:45:27,231
He bets on everything, anything--

836
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:29,300
Huge cash bets all the time.

837
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:31,035
Once, the bellagio put Bill Gates

838
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:34,271
out of the high-roller's suite
'cause liyuan was flying in.

839
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:35,538
He is the perfect Vic.

840
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:39,175
But how did you know who he was gonna pick?!

841
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:40,876
We told him to.

842
00:45:40,877 --> 00:45:43,346
We've been telling him all day.

843
00:45:43,347 --> 00:45:45,580
From the moment he left his hotel room,

844
00:45:45,581 --> 00:45:48,583
we've been priming him, programming his subconscious.

845
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:53,020
He's been seeing the number 55 all day long...

846
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:54,890
On the elevator...

847
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:57,591
...in the lobby...

848
00:45:57,592 --> 00:46:01,428
...even the stick pin on the doorman.

849
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,496
Not only that, we loaded his route

850
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,431
from the hotel to the stadium.

851
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:08,134
He looks out the window, primers are everywhere.

852
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:09,836
Local 55!

853
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:12,671
Now he doesn't see it, but he does.

854
00:46:12,672 --> 00:46:16,408
There's no getting around it.

855
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:18,377
- He even sees Farhad.
- Let's go!

856
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:19,944
I'm trying to drive, you rhino bitch!

857
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:22,080
Fuck the rhinos!
Fuck the...

858
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:23,515
Suggestions are everywhere,

859
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:25,883
from the number of flowers in a vase

860
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,652
to the tramp stamp on the hooker

861
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:30,055
we sent to his room last night.

862
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,725
That is genius.

863
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,327
Yeah, and it's not only what he sees--

864
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,528
It's what he hears.

865
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:42,565
The mandarin word for "five" is wu.

866
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,202
There are 124 "Whoo-whoos"
in "sympathy for the devil."

867
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,571
Now, he's not registering it, but it's all there.

868
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:54,376
So when he picks up those binoculars,

869
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:56,243
looks out on the field,

870
00:46:56,244 --> 00:46:59,813
sees a familiar face with the number 55 on his Jersey,

871
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:02,516
some little voice in the back
of his mind says, "that's it."

872
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:06,118
And he thinks it's intuition, and he picks.

873
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,354
Do you want me to write it down?

874
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,191
And you being in the dark was the convincer.

875
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:17,295
We call that the "little blind mouse."

876
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:18,697
I'm the blind mouse?

877
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:21,233
You're such an asshole.

878
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:23,467
You can't tell me that's 100% real.

879
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:25,336
Well, it's probabilistic.

880
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:29,106
Farhad has it at about 59%, but it's better than Vegas.

881
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:32,241
And what if he picked wrong?

882
00:47:32,242 --> 00:47:34,076
Double it till it happens.

883
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:35,978
That's amazing.

884
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,082
You're amazing.

885
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,584
Nicky!

886
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,125
What's wrong?

887
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:56,232
You did great.

888
00:47:57,965 --> 00:48:00,101
Okay.

889
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:08,809
W-what's going on?
Why are we pulling over?

890
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:14,813
Nicky?

891
00:48:14,814 --> 00:48:18,016
What is this?

892
00:48:18,017 --> 00:48:20,318
It's 80.

893
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,221
The job is over.

894
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:25,756
You did great.

895
00:48:25,757 --> 00:48:27,924
You're kidding, right?

896
00:48:27,925 --> 00:48:29,426
You're...

897
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:32,495
Take her to the airport.

898
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:33,930
No, I'm not going to the airport.

899
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:36,566
Wait. Can you just talk to me?
Can you just-- Nicky?

900
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:38,034
Sorry.
You did great.

901
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:39,502
What's going on?
You did good.

902
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:40,503
Answer me!

903
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:42,572
Nicky!

904
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:11,217
Wasn't expecting such a kind face.

905
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:14,486
The tech says his gizmo checks out,

906
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:18,055
but in all candor, I don't like this.

907
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,057
And I don't like him.

908
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:23,460
Why?

909
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:26,997
He's a con man, sir.

910
00:50:26,998 --> 00:50:29,900
That's the point.

911
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,435
I keep my beretta well-fed.

912
00:50:32,436 --> 00:50:36,706
Owens, why do you have to be so dramatic?

913
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:40,876
Invite him to lunch.

914
00:50:44,447 --> 00:50:46,248
You are a man known for great skills

915
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:47,816
of persuasion and deception.

916
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:53,254
You were very hard for me to find.

917
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:54,756
Why did you take my offer?

918
00:50:54,757 --> 00:50:55,991
Went broke.

919
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,964
My car-- 40 million euro
in R&D, easy.

920
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:05,598
Mcewen, rahal, lotus--

921
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,268
Any team in any class, they spend half of that.

922
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,270
But I have something none of them have.

923
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:13,806
A fuel-burn algorithm.

924
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:16,875
Yes. The EXR.
They all want it.

925
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:18,676
It's legal.

926
00:51:18,677 --> 00:51:23,047
And my engineers promise it guarantees me a win.

927
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:25,048
That's not enough for me.

928
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:28,418
This year, McEwen is the only team standing in my way.

929
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,853
That is why I wanted you.

930
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:33,222
So--
This needs to be discreet.

931
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,626
It needs to be safe.
No holes.

932
00:51:49,805 --> 00:51:54,207
I will pose as a disgruntled team engineer of yours,

933
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,244
offering to sell the EXR to McEwen.

934
00:51:57,245 --> 00:51:59,246
What I will give him is a fake.

935
00:51:59,247 --> 00:52:01,047
It just doesn't really do anything,

936
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,683
just gives false readings to their instruments.

937
00:52:03,684 --> 00:52:05,618
It will mislead the driver enough

938
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:07,687
that you'll have a slight added edge.

939
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:09,955
A third of a second every few laps.

940
00:52:09,956 --> 00:52:11,189
Imperceptible.

941
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,092
Just because the techs say that it checks out,

942
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:15,060
what makes you think you can convince them

943
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:16,995
that you're absolutely real,

944
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:19,763
you're-- that you're totally authentic?

945
00:52:19,764 --> 00:52:22,134
You can't be dicking around here, boy.

946
00:52:24,769 --> 00:52:27,337
You don't need to worry about me.

947
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:29,572
I'm extremely well-researched.

948
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:31,507
We will proceed as planned,

949
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:34,311
starting at the kickoff party tonight.

950
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:35,711
Okay.

951
00:52:35,712 --> 00:52:38,280
I'll be seen drinking and boisterous

952
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,981
and disgruntled.

953
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:43,652
I will approach you in full view of McEwen.

954
00:52:43,653 --> 00:52:46,688
An argument will ensue, I will throw my drink,

955
00:52:46,689 --> 00:52:49,524
I will shove you, if that's okay wit you.

956
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:51,726
It's okay.
I'd be very surprised

957
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:53,860
if McEwen didn't approach me right there,

958
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:55,662
but if not, I will contact him.

959
00:52:55,663 --> 00:52:58,665
Good.
Whatever he's willing to pay me,

960
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:00,800
I will be keeping 100% for myself,

961
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:03,035
on top of the $1 million from you.

962
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:04,270
Do we have a deal?

963
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:06,205
Yes, Mr. Garriga, we have a deal.

964
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:07,573
That's great.

965
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:08,941
Appreciate your time.

966
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:11,410
Thank you.
I'll see you tonight.

967
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:17,348
Don't say I didn't warn you.

968
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:20,017
Drama.

969
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:21,686
I'm excited.

970
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,618
That's right.

971
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:07,459
Estoy aqu? Por trabajo.
Do you speak English?

972
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,660
Yes.

973
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:10,129
Absolutely.
Yeah, but you s--

974
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,930
You speak good Spanish.
No, no, no, not so much.

975
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,965
Yes.
Why, thank you, thank you.

976
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,666
Okay, what can I get for you?
Look, I'm here tonight for business.

977
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:18,569
And I am a recovering alcoholic.

978
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,605
So when I ask you for a vodka Martini on the rocks,

979
00:54:21,606 --> 00:54:24,140
if you could give me water with olives,

980
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:25,509
that would be fantastic.

981
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,379
Great decision, sir. Wise.
Thank you.

982
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:31,847
And the thing is, um, I-I don't even drink.

983
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:33,749
That man got me drinking again.

984
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,018
Okay, vodka Martini on the rocks.
On the rocks.

985
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:39,655
I wonder if "Garriga" is Spanish for "thief."

986
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:41,723
My God, what a drinker!

987
00:54:41,724 --> 00:54:43,658
Who the fuck put a couch full of women

988
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:45,159
in the middle of this place?

989
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,694
Hey!

990
00:54:46,695 --> 00:54:49,863
Where are all the black people?!

991
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:52,566
There he is, right there, the commander in thief!

992
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:56,604
But I guess you can do what you
want when you're a rich prick!

993
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:58,671
Maybe you should slow down a little?

994
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,274
Wait. Girl, no, no.
I just want to talk to the man.

995
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:02,541
This is a free country.

996
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:04,844
Buenos Aires is a free country, right?

997
00:55:04,845 --> 00:55:06,279
No, Buenos Aires is a city.

998
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,146
Okay, I'm gonna go over here.

999
00:55:08,147 --> 00:55:10,148
Hey!

1000
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:11,017
Hey!

1001
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:40,408
Well, hello.

1002
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:42,178
Hey.

1003
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:46,180
Hello.

1004
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:47,515
God, it's been a long time.

1005
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:52,085
So, you--
You here with...

1006
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:53,820
Rafael?
Yeah.

1007
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:57,156
Yeah, he, um-- he owns one of the teams so...

1008
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:58,725
Is he a mark?

1009
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,326
No.

1010
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:02,360
We're together.

1011
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:04,097
Have been for a long time.

1012
00:56:06,432 --> 00:56:09,203
I'm out of the game.

1013
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:13,873
Jess, um...

1014
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:19,176
All right, about New Orleans, and just--

1015
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:20,945
Nicky. No.
Nah, just the way that--

1016
00:56:20,946 --> 00:56:24,414
I really don't need an explanation.

1017
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,583
I mean, if anything, I should be thanking you.

1018
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:27,952
You did me a favor.

1019
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,089
Well, that's fantastic.

1020
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,724
He's probably wondering where I am.

1021
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,793
Take care of yourself, okay?

1022
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,561
You too. Be well.

1023
00:56:40,562 --> 00:56:41,963
Um, Nicky?

1024
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:47,367
He doesn't know about my past, so...

1025
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:52,072
You don't know me, okay?

1026
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:53,173
Okay.

1027
00:56:53,174 --> 00:56:54,473
Thank you.

1028
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:55,843
You're welcome.

1029
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,618
Alcohol.

1030
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:09,154
Can I get a vodka, please?

1031
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:10,524
Sure.

1032
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:18,662
This is water.

1033
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:20,398
No, sir, it's vodka.

1034
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:21,798
It's water.

1035
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:23,233
Sir, I know who you are.

1036
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,402
Marcello told me about you and your condition,

1037
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:27,038
so back off.

1038
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,309
All right.
You're kidding.

1039
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:48,323
Are you drunk?

1040
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:56,363
Mr. Garriga is not a guy
you want to cross.

1041
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:58,699
Me neither.

1042
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:03,169
Now, just what part of the plan

1043
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:06,504
calls for a tray full of appletinis?

1044
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:09,340
You pledging a sorority?

1045
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:12,844
I'm just rethinking the plan a little bit.

1046
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:18,115
Goddamn prima Donna delicate science bullshit.

1047
00:58:18,116 --> 00:58:20,283
You are not splitting atoms here, pal.

1048
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:21,953
This ain't cern.

1049
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:24,186
Just do what you're being paid to do.

1050
00:58:24,187 --> 00:58:26,088
Shitheel.

1051
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,290
Yeah.

1052
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,460
Yeah.

1053
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:31,895
Okay. Okay.

1054
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,573
Hey!

1055
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:49,777
Garriga!

1056
00:58:49,778 --> 00:58:51,644
God.
Don't worry.

1057
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:53,480
It's just a disgruntled engineer.

1058
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:56,516
I expect you have something to say to me.

1059
00:58:56,517 --> 00:58:58,251
My God.

1060
00:58:58,252 --> 00:58:59,685
Shit.

1061
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,454
Why are you punching?

1062
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,489
You stole from me!

1063
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,990
Nobody steals from me!

1064
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:08,626
I am such a disgruntled engineer!

1065
00:59:08,627 --> 00:59:10,761
Get him out of here!

1066
00:59:10,762 --> 00:59:13,130
Out! Get out!

1067
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:14,799
Oversold it a bit, didn't you?

1068
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,834
I was just caught up in the moment.

1069
00:59:16,835 --> 00:59:18,868
Aah!
Get him out.

1070
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:19,903
Get rid of him.

1071
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:22,672
Okay. I'm good.

1072
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:24,676
Go back to the party.

1073
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,410
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

1074
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:30,246
What the hell was that?

1075
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:32,348
Racing business, cari? O.

1076
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:34,417
Jesus.
That's all.

1077
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:35,917
Wait a minute.

1078
00:59:35,918 --> 00:59:38,587
You can't throw me out.
I'm staying in this hotel.

1079
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:40,856
Let me see your keys.

1080
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:47,362
Thank you.

1081
00:59:57,104 --> 00:59:58,605
Mr. McEwen would like to have lunch.

1082
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:01,676
Information is on the card.

1083
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:05,778
I still got it.

1084
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:21,658
You ever heard of udo pappenphus?

1085
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,627
What the fuck you looking at?

1086
01:00:24,628 --> 01:00:26,864
Nothing.

1087
01:00:28,132 --> 01:00:30,465
I'm sorry.
I meant--

1088
01:00:30,466 --> 01:00:33,302
Udo pappenphus was an engineer for Ferrari for many years.

1089
01:00:33,303 --> 01:00:34,603
Fuckin' brilliant.

1090
01:00:34,604 --> 01:00:37,173
One day, udo pappenphus

1091
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:39,340
was found behind a berm with his throat cut.

1092
01:00:39,341 --> 01:00:44,412
Udo, he was that prick Garriga's man.

1093
01:00:44,413 --> 01:00:45,913
I want three million euro.

1094
01:00:45,914 --> 01:00:47,548
Well, fuck.

1095
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:49,149
Jesus.
It's the EXR.

1096
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:52,086
The EXR.

1097
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:55,722
You're father fuckin' Christmas to me, mate.

1098
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:57,890
I'm gonna need to see some proof.

1099
01:00:57,891 --> 01:01:00,861
You understand? Proof.

1100
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,896
What the fuck are you lookin' at, mate?

1101
01:01:04,897 --> 01:01:08,333
Nothin'.
Just repeat what you said.

1102
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,168
What, the pool go euro?

1103
01:01:10,169 --> 01:01:11,669
Gordon!

1104
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:14,171
Get me fuckin' field glasses, mate.

1105
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:15,839
They're on the--
On the thing.

1106
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,008
Yeah.
She is a beauty.

1107
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:19,643
I love these race skanks.

1108
01:01:19,644 --> 01:01:20,911
She's not a race skank.

1109
01:01:20,912 --> 01:01:22,613
'Course she's a fuckin' race skank.

1110
01:01:22,614 --> 01:01:23,813
Town's lousy with them.

1111
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:25,414
Can we get back to business?
Please.

1112
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,283
She's a little small on top for my taste, but...

1113
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,218
'Kay, one man's small is another man's perfection.

1114
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:32,987
It's like a "breasts are a subjective opinion" topic.

1115
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:35,023
Maybe if you're bookin' a fashion show, mate.

1116
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,092
I'm talkin' about fuckin' slapping balls, mate.

1117
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,894
Do you-- do you want the thing or not?

1118
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,929
I'm gonna need to see proof.

1119
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,099
I'll contact you.

1120
01:01:45,466 --> 01:01:47,134
Hola.
Hola.

1121
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,669
¿Qué te gustar? A Tomar?

1122
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,336
A Spritz, por favor.
Okay.

1123
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:53,273
And a vodka and cranberry, please.

1124
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:57,944
Hey, you need to put some clothes on.

1125
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:59,678
Excuse me?

1126
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,946
There's Australian people here.

1127
01:02:01,947 --> 01:02:03,482
What is that supposed to mean?

1128
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:04,716
I'm just saying, Jess,

1129
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:07,418
they shipped all those people down there for a reason.

1130
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:08,719
Okay.

1131
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,489
Gracias.

1132
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,324
Whoa, what--?

1133
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,392
You don't know me, remember?

1134
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:19,729
And what was that last night?

1135
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:22,866
Was that... About me?

1136
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:25,734
Please. No.

1137
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:27,870
Are you working an angle on Rafael?

1138
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:29,938
No, Jess.
I'm workin' for him.

1139
01:02:29,939 --> 01:02:32,575
But I wouldn't trust him if I were you.

1140
01:02:32,576 --> 01:02:33,976
But I should trust you?

1141
01:02:33,977 --> 01:02:36,477
All right, Jess--
That's interesting.

1142
01:02:36,478 --> 01:02:37,779
Okay, Jess, come on.

1143
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,048
Nicky, if Rafael sees us together,

1144
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:42,750
I don't know what's gonna happen, okay?

1145
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,451
He's the jealous type.

1146
01:02:44,452 --> 01:02:47,454
You need to stay away from me.

1147
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:49,623
Fuck Rafael.

1148
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:51,525
And, Nicky?

1149
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:52,892
You're still an easy lift.

1150
01:02:52,893 --> 01:02:55,495
Stop touching my shit, Jess.

1151
01:02:57,764 --> 01:03:00,600
Have him punch it, mate, on the straightaway.

1152
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:01,866
Well?

1153
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:03,303
Looks credible.

1154
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:06,871
Three million?

1155
01:03:06,872 --> 01:03:08,173
Yes, sir.

1156
01:03:08,174 --> 01:03:11,341
I can have the complete package in 48 hours.

1157
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,844
Codes, documentation, and analysis.

1158
01:03:13,845 --> 01:03:15,012
No worries, mate.

1159
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:17,948
No worries.
So, what's next?

1160
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:19,517
Wait for my call.

1161
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:22,620
Thank you.

1162
01:03:26,123 --> 01:03:28,824
- Hola.
- Hola.

1163
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:30,325
Se? Or Garriga's assistant called.

1164
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:32,728
She pulled a few things she said you might like.

1165
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:35,096
Great.

1166
01:03:43,972 --> 01:03:47,841
¡Hola! Sir!
Miss?

1167
01:03:47,842 --> 01:03:50,843
You forgot...

1168
01:03:52,046 --> 01:03:54,048
...your bag.

1169
01:04:10,196 --> 01:04:13,062
You really should be more aware.

1170
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:18,336
God. Seriously?

1171
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:24,507
Malbec?

1172
01:04:24,508 --> 01:04:26,041
Yes, it is.

1173
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,843
Where'd you learn that?

1174
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:29,812
It's all they drink here.

1175
01:04:29,813 --> 01:04:32,115
And it says it on the label.

1176
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:38,319
You know, Nicky, I've been thinking about all this.

1177
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,255
And?

1178
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:45,459
And, um...

1179
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,694
Nicky...

1180
01:04:47,695 --> 01:04:48,794
Let me have it.

1181
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:50,229
Nicky, if we just ran.

1182
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:51,864
If we just....You know,

1183
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:53,299
if I could slip away,

1184
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,767
or if we could--
Yes.

1185
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:55,802
Can we just...?

1186
01:04:55,803 --> 01:04:57,304
Whatever. Yes.

1187
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:03,108
I can't.

1188
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,877
I can't, I'm sorry.

1189
01:05:05,878 --> 01:05:07,278
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, Jess.

1190
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:10,047
Whatever you want.

1191
01:05:10,048 --> 01:05:13,551
I can keep you safe.

1192
01:05:13,552 --> 01:05:14,752
Nicky...

1193
01:05:14,753 --> 01:05:16,421
Come on, Jess.

1194
01:05:21,192 --> 01:05:24,393
Nicky, you taught me so much.

1195
01:05:24,394 --> 01:05:28,264
But I've learned a lot since then.

1196
01:05:28,265 --> 01:05:30,566
And I'd really...

1197
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:34,737
Like to show you all the things I've learned.

1198
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:42,376
Like how I learned how to play men.

1199
01:05:42,377 --> 01:05:45,580
Like I just played you.

1200
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:50,916
How's it feel?

1201
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:52,484
Wow.

1202
01:05:52,485 --> 01:05:53,352
Yeah.

1203
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:54,152
Wow.

1204
01:05:54,153 --> 01:05:55,454
I think you're losing it.

1205
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,122
That was pathetic.

1206
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:58,590
"I'll keep you safe"?

1207
01:05:58,591 --> 01:06:00,124
What was that?
That-- that was--

1208
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:02,159
Does that work?
Does that get you laid?

1209
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,495
Hey, that was not a line.

1210
01:06:03,496 --> 01:06:05,196
I'm not falling for your shit again.

1211
01:06:05,197 --> 01:06:06,898
Don't okay?

1212
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:08,798
And I'm very happy.

1213
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,470
So stay away from me.

1214
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,616
Nice ass-o.

1215
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,884
Nice ass. Nice ass.

1216
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:33,021
Very nice, very nice.

1217
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,023
Mi hermano.

1218
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,390
Hey.
Let's get a steak.

1219
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:38,893
A steak?
It's 9:00 in the mornin'.

1220
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,728
Take that up with God.

1221
01:06:40,729 --> 01:06:41,762
How was the flight?

1222
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:43,330
Jesus Christ.

1223
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:45,498
They had me squeezed between two fat guys.

1224
01:06:45,499 --> 01:06:47,400
It sounds like you're complaining,

1225
01:06:47,401 --> 01:06:49,368
and you shouldn't be because I'm giving you a cut.

1226
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:52,240
All right, where's this going down?

1227
01:06:57,576 --> 01:06:59,345
You got the piece?
It's in my bag.

1228
01:06:59,346 --> 01:07:01,647
Can you get it?
I'm too fat to reach it.

1229
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:04,550
Watch this.
Nothin' but net.

1230
01:07:09,188 --> 01:07:10,921
Fuck, you all right?
Yeah.

1231
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:12,490
Ya all right?

1232
01:07:20,197 --> 01:07:21,697
Hey there.

1233
01:07:21,698 --> 01:07:24,800
Farhad?!

1234
01:07:24,801 --> 01:07:27,136
Hi! How are you?

1235
01:07:27,137 --> 01:07:28,971
God, look at you!

1236
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:31,672
You've lost so much weight.

1237
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,640
I did a cleanse.

1238
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:34,876
You here with Nicky?
Sort of.

1239
01:07:34,877 --> 01:07:37,346
Do you mind?
Please.

1240
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,149
You must be really turned on

1241
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:43,217
with all these beautiful women here.

1242
01:07:43,218 --> 01:07:44,384
I-I suppose.

1243
01:07:44,385 --> 01:07:45,819
You do more than suppose.

1244
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,188
What does that mean?

1245
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:49,622
Dear God!
I'm just sayin'.

1246
01:07:49,623 --> 01:07:51,424
Please never make that face again.

1247
01:07:51,425 --> 01:07:53,092
I don't even want to know what that means.

1248
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:54,360
I think we do.

1249
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,361
I think we don't.

1250
01:07:56,362 --> 01:07:57,662
God, I missed you.

1251
01:07:57,663 --> 01:07:59,164
Listen, everybody knows you're a lesbian.

1252
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:00,232
It's completely fine.
Who knows I'm a lesbian?

1253
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:01,366
It's especially fine to me.

1254
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:02,734
Where are you getting this from?

1255
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:04,870
Every other time you speak, I smell a vagina.

1256
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:06,437
It's not true.

1257
01:08:06,438 --> 01:08:08,572
That's not a bad thing, believe me.

1258
01:08:08,573 --> 01:08:09,840
Jesus.

1259
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:11,276
Okay, all right.

1260
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:19,582
Listen, you got Nicky all nuts.

1261
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,783
I do? Good.
Yeah.

1262
01:08:20,784 --> 01:08:22,352
I've never seen him like this.

1263
01:08:22,353 --> 01:08:24,052
You know, he's barely worked since New Orleans.

1264
01:08:24,053 --> 01:08:26,021
Seriously?

1265
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:29,825
I know he's an asshole.
I mean, a really big asshole.

1266
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:31,627
Yeah.
He should've handled it better.

1267
01:08:31,628 --> 01:08:34,528
But he's my friend, and I'm gonna bat for him.

1268
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,363
So can you give him a break?

1269
01:08:36,364 --> 01:08:38,365
I don't care what Nicky told you.

1270
01:08:38,366 --> 01:08:40,267
I'm not falling for this shit.

1271
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:42,469
Yeah, I don't think you got that right.

1272
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:45,438
He seems different now, and I've known him a long time.

1273
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,409
How do I know that?

1274
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:51,009
What is that?

1275
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,679
It's an orange.

1276
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:01,886
He kept it for you all this time.

1277
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,656
Flea market!

1278
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:09,427
Shit.

1279
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:15,665
That looks nice.

1280
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,166
I can't believe you kept it.

1281
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:19,068
Or found it.

1282
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:20,303
Or replicated it.

1283
01:09:21,538 --> 01:09:24,139
I don't know with you.
No, I kept it.

1284
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,740
Thank you.

1285
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:27,909
So, Farhad said you didn't work for a long time.

1286
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:33,381
Yeah, a couple years.
Just didn't feel right.

1287
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:35,616
I even reached out to my dad.

1288
01:09:35,617 --> 01:09:37,551
I hadn't seen him in years.

1289
01:09:37,552 --> 01:09:40,020
I asked him if he'd ever gone straight before.

1290
01:09:40,021 --> 01:09:42,489
"Of course. I go straight
every time I'm on parole."

1291
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:45,125
"Now drink a cup of concrete. Man up."

1292
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:47,060
Solid advice.
Yes.

1293
01:09:48,362 --> 01:09:50,764
How's that working out?

1294
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:52,732
Well, thought I was ready to work.

1295
01:09:55,535 --> 01:09:57,836
Then the girl walked in.

1296
01:09:57,837 --> 01:10:01,574
Why are you going to all this trouble, Nicky?

1297
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,642
What do you want from me?

1298
01:10:05,643 --> 01:10:10,313
I can convince anyone of anything.

1299
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:11,814
I once convinced a man

1300
01:10:11,815 --> 01:10:15,351
that an empty warehouse was the federal reserve.

1301
01:10:15,352 --> 01:10:17,320
So I'm good.
Yeah.

1302
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:20,322
You're the best.

1303
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:21,924
But what I really want

1304
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:24,426
is to tell you that I've changed.

1305
01:10:24,427 --> 01:10:27,195
And tell you that I am sorry.

1306
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:30,466
I just want you to believe me.

1307
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:43,677
You know I want to believe you.

1308
01:10:43,678 --> 01:10:45,546
I want to believe you.

1309
01:10:45,547 --> 01:10:47,815
I'm different now.

1310
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:55,320
I have to be getting back.

1311
01:10:55,321 --> 01:10:57,290
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

1312
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,210
Muevete.

1313
01:11:55,975 --> 01:11:57,442
You all right?

1314
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:58,710
What happened?

1315
01:11:58,711 --> 01:12:00,444
I don't want to talk about it.

1316
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:02,346
Did he do somethin' to you?
No.

1317
01:12:02,347 --> 01:12:04,915
Jess, did he put his hands on you?

1318
01:12:04,916 --> 01:12:06,783
Tell me what happened.

1319
01:12:06,784 --> 01:12:09,054
Just kiss me.

1320
01:13:02,034 --> 01:13:05,203
I have to leave soon.

1321
01:13:05,204 --> 01:13:09,306
I want you to come with me.

1322
01:13:09,307 --> 01:13:13,076
I know you think you love him.

1323
01:13:13,077 --> 01:13:19,449
But... I want you to come with me tonight.

1324
01:13:21,517 --> 01:13:25,354
I don't love him.
I just-- but I--

1325
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:27,655
But you can't trust me.

1326
01:13:27,656 --> 01:13:29,857
I understand that.

1327
01:13:29,858 --> 01:13:33,161
If you come with me, we'll figure it out.

1328
01:13:33,162 --> 01:13:35,330
I want--

1329
01:13:45,305 --> 01:13:47,708
It's Owens.
I got to take it.

1330
01:13:49,309 --> 01:13:51,744
Yeah.

1331
01:13:51,745 --> 01:13:52,945
Where are you?

1332
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:54,311
I'm in my room.

1333
01:13:54,312 --> 01:13:56,480
Good. I'm at the door.

1334
01:13:56,481 --> 01:13:58,283
He's at the do--

1335
01:13:58,284 --> 01:13:59,450
All right.
What?

1336
01:13:59,451 --> 01:14:00,919
Um...
Damn, you should've ma--

1337
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,053
A'ight.
Give me a sec.

1338
01:14:03,054 --> 01:14:04,621
We're good.

1339
01:14:04,622 --> 01:14:08,058
Just I'll get rid of him.

1340
01:14:08,059 --> 01:14:09,694
Hey.

1341
01:14:12,295 --> 01:14:13,696
You're still sleeping?

1342
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:16,432
I thought you were meeting with McEwen.

1343
01:14:16,433 --> 01:14:18,469
I am. Later.

1344
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:25,607
There's a lazy Sunday softness to your generation.

1345
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,642
Makes me uncomfortable.

1346
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,943
I like to be on my feet.

1347
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:32,646
I'll lie down when I get cancer.

1348
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:34,882
Or if I fuck.

1349
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:37,318
Both of which will be done on my back,

1350
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:38,919
in case you were wondering.

1351
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,488
Um, no, actually, I-I wasn't wondering.

1352
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:44,324
But thank you for sharing that.

1353
01:14:44,325 --> 01:14:45,658
Sarcasm.

1354
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:47,559
Another pillar of your generation.

1355
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,594
You want to tell somebody to fuck off,

1356
01:14:49,595 --> 01:14:50,896
tell 'em to fuck off.

1357
01:14:50,897 --> 01:14:52,731
Don't say, "Gee, what a great jacket."

1358
01:14:52,732 --> 01:14:54,566
It's weakness.

1359
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:57,501
That is a messy bed.

1360
01:14:57,502 --> 01:15:00,271
Yeah, I don't sleep well.

1361
01:15:00,272 --> 01:15:01,272
Someone here, son?

1362
01:15:01,273 --> 01:15:02,439
Who you callin' "son"?

1363
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,242
You know why you don't sleep well?

1364
01:15:04,243 --> 01:15:05,642
No, tell me.

1365
01:15:05,643 --> 01:15:08,411
You with your iPhones and your smart phones

1366
01:15:08,412 --> 01:15:10,447
and your laptops and computers.

1367
01:15:10,448 --> 01:15:12,015
All of which produce nothing

1368
01:15:12,016 --> 01:15:14,483
but a barrage of useless information.

1369
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:16,852
Fucking Twitter.

1370
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:18,888
As if anyone actually cares

1371
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:22,557
that you're eating a Turkey sandwich for lunch.

1372
01:15:22,558 --> 01:15:25,894
Sorry... Panini.

1373
01:15:25,895 --> 01:15:27,161
Sarcasm?

1374
01:15:27,162 --> 01:15:28,195
Satire.

1375
01:15:28,196 --> 01:15:30,098
Fuckin' panini.

1376
01:15:30,099 --> 01:15:31,532
Look, um...

1377
01:15:31,533 --> 01:15:34,167
Are we done?

1378
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:36,570
You might be.

1379
01:15:36,571 --> 01:15:38,772
Who'd you pick up at the airport?

1380
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:40,641
What, Garriga has you fuckin' following me?

1381
01:15:40,642 --> 01:15:42,842
I got people there.
My computer guy.

1382
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:44,176
Why? Is there a problem?

1383
01:15:44,177 --> 01:15:47,648
There won't be because he's fucking here.

1384
01:15:48,983 --> 01:15:51,849
I got a little red hair on my taint

1385
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,386
that tickles when somethin's afoot.

1386
01:15:54,387 --> 01:15:56,320
And lately,

1387
01:15:56,321 --> 01:16:00,592
I've been scratching my nethers like a fuckin' macaque.

1388
01:16:02,327 --> 01:16:04,962
Okay.

1389
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:10,433
Look, there's no reason for anybody to panic

1390
01:16:10,434 --> 01:16:12,902
and start gettin' bent out of shape

1391
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:15,740
because we're getting to the end.

1392
01:16:46,099 --> 01:16:48,001
Nice day.

1393
01:16:53,606 --> 01:16:55,708
Nicky!

1394
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:01,012
How the fuck did you do--?

1395
01:17:01,013 --> 01:17:02,545
God.

1396
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:04,114
Back here. 7:00.

1397
01:17:04,115 --> 01:17:05,749
Okay.

1398
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:10,853
Guess your taint was wrong.

1399
01:17:10,854 --> 01:17:13,856
Enough of the pleasantries.

1400
01:17:13,857 --> 01:17:15,524
Hey, nice jacket.

1401
01:17:15,525 --> 01:17:18,095
Fuck off.

1402
01:17:26,135 --> 01:17:27,268
It's real.

1403
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:28,603
Gordon?

1404
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:33,274
Gordon!

1405
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:34,508
Fuckin' you, mate.

1406
01:17:34,509 --> 01:17:37,244
You're my new fuckin' favorite person, fella.

1407
01:17:37,245 --> 01:17:39,645
I-I fuckin' swear you're fuckin'
six inches fuckin' taller

1408
01:17:39,646 --> 01:17:43,048
and twice as fuckin' handsome since you walked in here!

1409
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:45,885
There ya go, son!
Lap it up.

1410
01:17:45,886 --> 01:17:48,186
My pleasure, Mr. McEwen.
I wish you the best of luck.

1411
01:17:48,187 --> 01:17:50,655
Friends like you, who needs luck?

1412
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:51,724
Now fuck off!

1413
01:17:54,494 --> 01:17:55,759
Yes?
Mr. Garriga.

1414
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,961
How did it go?

1415
01:17:56,962 --> 01:17:58,662
It's done.
Good.

1416
01:17:58,663 --> 01:18:00,164
I wish you the best of luck.

1417
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:02,568
With friends like you, who needs luck?

1418
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,205
Jess, letting you know

1419
01:18:08,206 --> 01:18:10,173
I've left a key for you at the desk.

1420
01:18:10,174 --> 01:18:11,342
See you at 7:00.

1421
01:18:13,476 --> 01:18:15,844
Wish you the best of luck.

1422
01:18:15,845 --> 01:18:17,414
With friends like you, who needs luck?

1423
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:20,182
I wish you the best of luck.

1424
01:18:20,183 --> 01:18:22,218
With friends like you, who needs luck?

1425
01:18:27,255 --> 01:18:28,689
I wish you the best of luck.

1426
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:31,159
With friends like you, who needs luck?

1427
01:18:32,593 --> 01:18:34,027
I wish you the best of luck.

1428
01:18:34,028 --> 01:18:35,795
With friends like you, who needs luck?

1429
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:37,063
Wish you the best of luck.

1430
01:18:37,064 --> 01:18:38,532
Friends like you, who needs luck?

1431
01:18:38,533 --> 01:18:41,133
Friends like you, who needs luck?

1432
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:43,003
Friends like you, who needs luck?

1433
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,548
Jess.

1434
01:18:57,784 --> 01:18:59,284
Jess?

1435
01:19:52,564 --> 01:19:56,435
Sorry I'm late.

1436
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:08,313
What?

1437
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:12,214
Nothin'.

1438
01:20:12,215 --> 01:20:13,917
Let's go.

1439
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,874
Goal!

1440
01:23:26,487 --> 01:23:28,655
Do you really think I'm such an amateur

1441
01:23:28,656 --> 01:23:31,158
that I would not have someone with McEwen?

1442
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:32,761
Someone to keep eyes on you?

1443
01:23:35,628 --> 01:23:37,596
20 years in this business

1444
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:40,933
teach you never to be too careful.

1445
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:42,635
He is my secret weapon.

1446
01:23:42,636 --> 01:23:45,804
Now imagine my surprise

1447
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:48,940
when Gordon showed me what you sold to McEwen.

1448
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,543
Not some fake softwares

1449
01:23:51,544 --> 01:23:53,310
as we discussed,

1450
01:23:53,311 --> 01:23:56,146
but my plans, my designs.

1451
01:23:56,147 --> 01:23:57,547
The real EXR!

1452
01:23:57,548 --> 01:23:59,884
Stolen from my servers, stolen from me!

1453
01:23:59,885 --> 01:24:01,252
What's more,

1454
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:04,120
you sold it to McEwen for 3 million Euros,

1455
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:07,557
but in these bags, there is 27 million Euros!

1456
01:24:07,558 --> 01:24:10,593
Which means you sold it to everyone!

1457
01:24:10,594 --> 01:24:12,227
This is my reputation!

1458
01:24:12,228 --> 01:24:13,962
This is my standing!

1459
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:17,233
You've made me look like an amateur.

1460
01:24:23,205 --> 01:24:26,441
That's what you get when you hire a con man.

1461
01:24:27,676 --> 01:24:29,142
Thieving piece of shit.

1462
01:24:29,143 --> 01:24:31,412
How did you get the information?

1463
01:24:34,348 --> 01:24:37,317
And what did she have to do with it?

1464
01:24:37,318 --> 01:24:39,651
All right. Nothin'. All right?
Listen--

1465
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:41,620
Tell me.
Hey.

1466
01:24:55,767 --> 01:24:58,703
Tell me!

1467
01:25:05,808 --> 01:25:07,843
Leave her the fuck alone!

1468
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:09,177
I'll tell you!

1469
01:25:09,178 --> 01:25:10,180
I have-- I-I have a guy.

1470
01:25:12,216 --> 01:25:15,016
He cracked your encryption.

1471
01:25:15,017 --> 01:25:17,986
He found a back door into your server.

1472
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:19,354
It was actually pretty easy.

1473
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:21,455
You should probably fire your IT guy.

1474
01:25:21,456 --> 01:25:23,523
No. No! You used my login.
My password.

1475
01:25:23,524 --> 01:25:25,725
Computer just tries every possible combination--

1476
01:25:25,726 --> 01:25:27,361
Bullshit!

1477
01:25:27,362 --> 01:25:31,930
This generates a new password every 15 minutes.

1478
01:25:31,931 --> 01:25:35,001
It never leaves my sight.

1479
01:25:35,002 --> 01:25:36,168
How did you get it?

1480
01:25:36,169 --> 01:25:37,370
Who the fuck cares, man?
It's done.

1481
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:38,839
Okay.

1482
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:43,441
Tell me!

1483
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:45,677
I want to know how!
Let her go!

1484
01:25:45,678 --> 01:25:47,345
How, how, how, how...
Let her go!

1485
01:25:47,346 --> 01:25:48,346
...how, how how?!
All right.

1486
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:49,114
How?!
It was her!

1487
01:25:49,115 --> 01:25:50,080
It was her.

1488
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:51,682
All right? It was her!

1489
01:25:51,683 --> 01:25:54,552
It was her.

1490
01:25:54,553 --> 01:25:58,254
It was her.

1491
01:25:58,255 --> 01:26:00,091
But she didn't know.

1492
01:26:01,358 --> 01:26:02,626
She didn't know anything.

1493
01:26:05,596 --> 01:26:08,432
Okay.

1494
01:26:09,766 --> 01:26:11,666
Your security was tight.

1495
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,368
It was tighter than I expected.

1496
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:16,072
I thought I could break the key, but I couldn't.

1497
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,040
Then I saw Jess at the party.

1498
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:23,143
And when I found out that the two of you were together,

1499
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,211
I knew she was my in.

1500
01:26:25,212 --> 01:26:27,080
So I used her.

1501
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:29,183
And I've been using her.

1502
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,953
You see, there's a science to getting people to trust you.

1503
01:26:33,954 --> 01:26:36,855
With women, it's all about
emotion. Connection.

1504
01:26:36,856 --> 01:26:40,826
That you feel the emotion as strongly as they do.

1505
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:42,828
They've been dreamin' about that shit

1506
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:44,929
ever since they were little girls.

1507
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:46,097
With her...
Farhad?!

1508
01:26:46,098 --> 01:26:47,532
...it was shared history.

1509
01:26:47,533 --> 01:26:49,434
How are you?
A friendly face.

1510
01:26:49,435 --> 01:26:51,902
Set her off balance.
Helps diffuse aggression.

1511
01:26:51,903 --> 01:26:53,203
You've lost so much weight!

1512
01:26:53,204 --> 01:26:55,739
Start discussing emotional shit.

1513
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,942
They're disarmed.
Now they're open.

1514
01:26:58,943 --> 01:27:00,611
You know you got 'em

1515
01:27:00,612 --> 01:27:02,745
when they start to unconsciously mimic you.

1516
01:27:02,746 --> 01:27:04,514
A head nod.

1517
01:27:04,515 --> 01:27:06,983
A hand gesture.
It means you're in sync.

1518
01:27:06,984 --> 01:27:11,119
Sociologists refer to it as the gauchais reaction.

1519
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,422
And then you move in for the kill.

1520
01:27:13,423 --> 01:27:16,090
You tell 'em how they've changed you.

1521
01:27:16,091 --> 01:27:18,026
I'm different, Jess.

1522
01:27:18,027 --> 01:27:20,094
Changed how you see the world.

1523
01:27:20,095 --> 01:27:22,229
Then you close.
A talisman.

1524
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:23,497
Well played.

1525
01:27:23,498 --> 01:27:25,299
A gift that says...
Thank you.

1526
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,700
"...you've always been in my thoughts."

1527
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,871
The necklace had a wireless keylogger in it.

1528
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,809
All I needed was for her to enter your room.

1529
01:27:36,943 --> 01:27:40,746
And when she did that, I had what I needed.

1530
01:27:45,018 --> 01:27:46,650
Picked up on your keystrokes.

1531
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:49,554
I logged in to your computer as you...

1532
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,892
And downloaded everything about the EXR.

1533
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,264
I'm sorry.

1534
01:28:01,599 --> 01:28:04,466
But it was not her fault.

1535
01:28:04,467 --> 01:28:07,937
She had no idea.
She got fooled.

1536
01:28:07,938 --> 01:28:11,039
So why don't we let her go.

1537
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:16,245
And me and you can do whatever the fuck you need to do.

1538
01:28:46,205 --> 01:28:47,706
I think he's lost his mind.

1539
01:28:47,707 --> 01:28:49,306
What's funny?

1540
01:28:49,307 --> 01:28:51,175
More bullshit.

1541
01:28:51,176 --> 01:28:52,976
What is so funny?

1542
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:55,045
More lies.

1543
01:28:55,046 --> 01:28:56,380
What the fuck is so funny?

1544
01:28:56,381 --> 01:28:59,317
What's so funny?

1545
01:29:00,117 --> 01:29:02,752
Garriga's not my boyfriend.

1546
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:04,587
What?

1547
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:06,154
I hardly even know him.

1548
01:29:06,155 --> 01:29:07,789
She's just a race skank.

1549
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:09,124
What's a race skank?

1550
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:10,593
But I saw you--
No.

1551
01:29:10,594 --> 01:29:13,595
You-- you saw what I wanted you to see.

1552
01:29:13,596 --> 01:29:15,463
You taught me that, remember?

1553
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:18,299
She's been driving me crazy.

1554
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,901
Hangin' around, flirtin', teasing.

1555
01:29:20,902 --> 01:29:23,105
The minute I try to get her up to my room...

1556
01:29:24,305 --> 01:29:25,305
But I have a headache.

1557
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:26,306
Cramps.

1558
01:29:26,307 --> 01:29:27,574
That time of the month.

1559
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:29,375
It's like a crime scene.

1560
01:29:29,376 --> 01:29:31,045
I have scrabble in my room.

1561
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:34,313
A headache. A period.
Right?

1562
01:29:34,314 --> 01:29:36,949
The world's longest period.

1563
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:39,051
She's never even been in my room.

1564
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:40,152
What?

1565
01:29:40,153 --> 01:29:41,853
We're so screwed.

1566
01:29:41,854 --> 01:29:44,823
What the fuck?

1567
01:29:44,824 --> 01:29:46,624
I was...
Trying to make you--

1568
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:48,126
What the fuck, Jess?!

1569
01:29:48,127 --> 01:29:50,561
I was trying to steal his watch!

1570
01:29:50,562 --> 01:29:52,196
This watch?
Yes!

1571
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:53,363
You're not still doing watches.

1572
01:29:53,364 --> 01:29:54,965
It's a piaget emperador!

1573
01:29:54,966 --> 01:29:57,301
It's worth 200 grand!

1574
01:29:57,302 --> 01:29:58,602
I'd been on him for a week.

1575
01:29:58,603 --> 01:30:00,102
I was waiting for my chance,

1576
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,637
and then you showed up.

1577
01:30:01,638 --> 01:30:03,439
You are so much better than watches, Jess.

1578
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,075
It's what I am good at, and I like it!

1579
01:30:06,076 --> 01:30:07,242
Okay, no, no, no.

1580
01:30:07,243 --> 01:30:09,177
When-- when you came to my hotel,

1581
01:30:09,178 --> 01:30:10,512
he had roughed you up.
No.

1582
01:30:10,513 --> 01:30:12,680
No, he had roughed me up.

1583
01:30:12,681 --> 01:30:14,749
She was stealing from him.

1584
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,718
He caught me racking up charges on Garriga's credit line,

1585
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,619
and he scared the shit out of me.

1586
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,488
This is really fucking unbelievable.

1587
01:30:20,489 --> 01:30:23,824
You did all of this to make me jealous?

1588
01:30:23,825 --> 01:30:26,459
No. Some of it was payback
for New Orleans, but...

1589
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,261
Yeah, to make you jealous.

1590
01:30:28,262 --> 01:30:30,063
I cannot believe you lied to me.

1591
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:32,098
You can't believe I lied?
Can't believe it.

1592
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:33,900
You can't believe I lied?
I can't believe it.

1593
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:36,468
That's so rich from you.
So rich from you.

1594
01:30:36,469 --> 01:30:37,636
That's what you want to say to me right--

1595
01:30:37,637 --> 01:30:39,171
Yeah, 'cause there's always a job.

1596
01:30:39,172 --> 01:30:40,505
Are you sure?
Always a job!

1597
01:30:40,506 --> 01:30:42,273
'Cause I just tried to save your life!

1598
01:30:42,274 --> 01:30:43,474
By lying!

1599
01:30:43,475 --> 01:30:45,976
'Cause you're always lying, Nicky!

1600
01:30:45,977 --> 01:30:47,912
I don't know when you're telling the truth!

1601
01:30:47,913 --> 01:30:51,317
And now we're dead!

1602
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,100
Fuck.

1603
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:15,770
She's right.
You're right.

1604
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:17,006
I'm...

1605
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:23,277
Here's the thing about lying.

1606
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:25,144
Here's the problem--
Fucks up all your options.

1607
01:31:25,145 --> 01:31:26,813
Paints you into a corner.

1608
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,381
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1609
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:29,982
Are you out of your mind?

1610
01:31:29,983 --> 01:31:32,951
And then you're forced to do some really dumb shit.

1611
01:31:32,952 --> 01:31:34,554
You want to die?

1612
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:38,024
Well, if I die, I want to die telling the truth.

1613
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:42,560
And if I lie, I want to lie like normal people lie.

1614
01:31:42,561 --> 01:31:44,629
I want my wife to say, "hey, honey.

1615
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:46,364
Do I look fat in these jeans?"

1616
01:31:46,365 --> 01:31:47,564
And I want to say,

1617
01:31:47,565 --> 01:31:50,334
"No, sweetie.
You look terrific.

1618
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,469
You should wear those."

1619
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:56,072
That's how I want to lie.

1620
01:31:56,073 --> 01:31:57,974
But this...

1621
01:31:57,975 --> 01:32:02,077
If I'm done...

1622
01:32:02,078 --> 01:32:04,180
I'm gonna tell the truth.

1623
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:09,485
So, Mr. Garriga,
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1624
01:32:12,588 --> 01:32:15,724
And you are not gonna like it at all.

1625
01:32:18,727 --> 01:32:20,262
About a year ago, I pick up the phone--

1626
01:32:21,463 --> 01:32:22,563
- What are you--?!
- Nicky?!

1627
01:32:22,564 --> 01:32:24,464
What the fuck are you doing?!

1628
01:32:24,465 --> 01:32:25,565
I couldn't take another fucking word.

1629
01:32:25,566 --> 01:32:27,167
Shit!

1630
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:28,168
You're next honey.

1631
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:29,436
No! Are you crazy?

1632
01:32:29,437 --> 01:32:30,904
Look at me.

1633
01:32:30,905 --> 01:32:32,438
What the hell were you thinking?

1634
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:34,974
Fuck you!

1635
01:32:36,609 --> 01:32:38,043
Now somebody's hurt.

1636
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:39,245
You're fine.

1637
01:32:39,246 --> 01:32:40,745
You know what?
I have nothing to do with this.

1638
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:42,814
Nicky, look at me.
Look at me. It's okay.

1639
01:32:42,815 --> 01:32:44,482
This is your mess.
It's okay. Hey.

1640
01:32:44,483 --> 01:32:45,449
You clean it up.
Nicky...

1641
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,417
And keep me out of it.

1642
01:32:49,787 --> 01:32:51,588
Shh.
I don't know what to do.

1643
01:32:51,589 --> 01:32:53,357
Please, please, please.

1644
01:32:53,358 --> 01:32:54,658
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

1645
01:32:54,659 --> 01:32:56,326
No, no, no, no.
No. Look at me.

1646
01:32:56,327 --> 01:32:57,794
Look at me.
Look at me.

1647
01:32:57,795 --> 01:32:59,795
It's fine. It's fine.
Nicky, look at me. Look at my eyes.

1648
01:32:59,796 --> 01:33:01,397
I love you, okay?
I love you. Please.

1649
01:33:01,398 --> 01:33:03,332
Please don't do this.
Please.

1650
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:06,369
Please.

1651
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:09,205
I trust you. I

1652
01:33:17,211 --> 01:33:20,814
you cannot leave me again.

1653
01:33:20,815 --> 01:33:25,519
Please do not leave me again.

1654
01:33:28,889 --> 01:33:30,591
Please.

1655
01:33:35,561 --> 01:33:36,995
No!
Aah!

1656
01:33:36,996 --> 01:33:39,297
What the fuck?!

1657
01:33:39,298 --> 01:33:40,565
You want him to fuckin' die?

1658
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:41,699
What kind of a piker are you,

1659
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,034
for chrissakes?!

1660
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,569
Shit!

1661
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:48,239
Didn't he tell you I was on the inside?

1662
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,740
Jesus.

1663
01:33:49,741 --> 01:33:51,475
You must be terrified.

1664
01:33:51,476 --> 01:33:54,410
It's gonna be okay.
He is not gonna die.

1665
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:55,378
Do you hear me?

1666
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:56,646
He is not gonna die.

1667
01:33:56,647 --> 01:33:58,181
Probably.

1668
01:33:58,182 --> 01:34:01,950
You see, you shoot between the third and the fourth rib,

1669
01:34:01,951 --> 01:34:04,954
just about eleven o'clock off the left nipple.

1670
01:34:04,955 --> 01:34:07,222
Here. Hold pressure on that.
Hold pressure on that.

1671
01:34:07,223 --> 01:34:08,290
Okay.

1672
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:09,591
That misses the heart

1673
01:34:09,592 --> 01:34:11,192
and the major arteries.

1674
01:34:11,193 --> 01:34:12,793
It does, however, puncture the lung.

1675
01:34:12,794 --> 01:34:14,895
Let me in.
There we go.

1676
01:34:14,896 --> 01:34:16,597
Is this Toledo panic button?

1677
01:34:16,598 --> 01:34:18,633
Maybe you're not such a piker after all.

1678
01:34:18,634 --> 01:34:22,602
Left untreated, you got about ten minutes

1679
01:34:22,603 --> 01:34:24,838
before you drown in your own blood.

1680
01:34:24,839 --> 01:34:28,540
But... You patch it up...

1681
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,475
You account for the cavity pressure...

1682
01:34:31,611 --> 01:34:33,245
Ha.
God.

1683
01:34:33,246 --> 01:34:34,814
And then...

1684
01:34:36,616 --> 01:34:39,450
There we go.
There we go.

1685
01:34:39,451 --> 01:34:42,054
There we go.
There's my boy.

1686
01:34:42,921 --> 01:34:45,156
Jesus.
There's my boy.

1687
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:48,892
Are you okay?

1688
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:51,528
Here, honey. Here. Hold on
to that. Hold on to that.

1689
01:34:51,529 --> 01:34:52,996
You're okay?
You keep your eye on that.

1690
01:34:52,997 --> 01:34:54,964
If he can't breathe, you pull the plunger again, okay?

1691
01:34:54,965 --> 01:34:56,833
Okay.

1692
01:34:56,834 --> 01:34:58,134
Good lord, I cannot believe

1693
01:34:58,135 --> 01:34:59,568
that you made me shoot you.
Are you okay?

1694
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,504
And then for what?
So that you can make

1695
01:35:01,505 --> 01:35:02,872
cow eyes at some race skank!

1696
01:35:02,873 --> 01:35:05,741
She is not a race skank!
I'm not a race skank!

1697
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:10,479
You die with the lie, mellow, and you still just might.

1698
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,613
Fuck you.
Jesus h. Christ.

1699
01:35:11,614 --> 01:35:12,779
Don't call me "mellow."

1700
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,248
You're his dad?

1701
01:35:14,249 --> 01:35:16,851
In the loosest fuckin' possible terms.

1702
01:35:16,852 --> 01:35:18,853
I'm bucky, by the way.

1703
01:35:18,854 --> 01:35:20,321
You know, I like you, honey.

1704
01:35:20,322 --> 01:35:21,621
You can take a punch.

1705
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:23,890
God.

1706
01:35:23,891 --> 01:35:25,758
And there it is.
Well, I tell you what,

1707
01:35:25,759 --> 01:35:26,959
you steal us a car, and I'll gather up the money.

1708
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,729
I can't steal a car.

1709
01:35:35,868 --> 01:35:39,904
I've been workin' for this prick spaniard for three years,

1710
01:35:39,905 --> 01:35:42,172
and he's got a guy at McEwen and doesn't tell me?

1711
01:35:42,173 --> 01:35:45,309
What the hell ever happened to trust?

1712
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:47,011
Are we almost there?

1713
01:35:47,012 --> 01:35:50,480
I bust my ass to get you that EXR crap and-- agh!

1714
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:52,916
And then the girl walked in.

1715
01:35:52,917 --> 01:35:54,918
Don't be an asshole.

1716
01:35:54,919 --> 01:35:57,485
That any way to talk to your father?

1717
01:35:57,486 --> 01:35:59,855
You're not my father.

1718
01:35:59,856 --> 01:36:01,158
You walked away.

1719
01:36:10,065 --> 01:36:13,034
I took you off the street.

1720
01:36:13,035 --> 01:36:16,438
Taught you my trade, I taught you my passion.

1721
01:36:17,706 --> 01:36:20,340
Three generations of skills.

1722
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:25,211
And in spite of all my earnest efforts,

1723
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:29,448
in spite of all my hard work,
you turned into a good person.

1724
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:31,617
Well, I just--

1725
01:36:31,618 --> 01:36:34,552
Go figure.

1726
01:36:34,553 --> 01:36:39,357
And I left you on the street for a good goddamn reason.

1727
01:36:39,358 --> 01:36:40,925
Because I was soft.

1728
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:43,493
That just shows what you know,

1729
01:36:43,494 --> 01:36:45,764
you dumb son of a bitch.

1730
01:36:52,569 --> 01:36:55,373
We had a good thing goin'.

1731
01:36:57,174 --> 01:37:01,677
And then one day, like seven years in,

1732
01:37:01,678 --> 01:37:03,679
we're running this poker deal in Boston

1733
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,514
and a guy pulled a gun.

1734
01:37:05,515 --> 01:37:06,782
Fucking gun!

1735
01:37:06,783 --> 01:37:09,050
Glock.
First time I'd ever seen one.

1736
01:37:09,051 --> 01:37:12,721
And I'm just--
I'm-- I'm paralyzed.

1737
01:37:14,355 --> 01:37:18,725
And all I could think about was the kid.

1738
01:37:18,726 --> 01:37:23,031
And I-I walked and I never looked back.

1739
01:37:26,467 --> 01:37:30,703
Love'll get you killed in this racket.

1740
01:37:30,704 --> 01:37:33,105
No place for that shit here.

1741
01:37:33,106 --> 01:37:37,141
No happiness with that.

1742
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:42,313
You know how they say there's honor among thieves?

1743
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:46,983
Well, you're no thief, mellow.

1744
01:37:46,984 --> 01:37:49,788
You made your choice.

1745
01:37:53,557 --> 01:37:56,126
So I'm taking the money.

1746
01:37:57,127 --> 01:37:59,328
All of it.

1747
01:37:59,329 --> 01:38:01,196
Mnh-Mnh.

1748
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:08,336
Well, that explains a lot.

1749
01:38:08,337 --> 01:38:10,705
Yeah, that's dad.

1750
01:38:10,706 --> 01:38:12,505
No!

1751
01:38:12,506 --> 01:38:13,573
Yep!

1752
01:38:13,574 --> 01:38:14,708
No!

1753
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:15,610
Yep!

1754
01:38:18,947 --> 01:38:22,249
See you at Christmas.

1755
01:38:27,654 --> 01:38:31,023
One, two, ready?

1756
01:38:31,024 --> 01:38:34,326
Okay, that's good, that's good.

1757
01:38:34,327 --> 01:38:37,362
Okay, almost there.

1758
01:38:37,363 --> 01:38:39,963
I don't know what we're gonna do now.

1759
01:38:39,964 --> 01:38:43,567
We'll be fine.

1760
01:38:43,568 --> 01:38:45,636
How?

1761
01:38:45,637 --> 01:38:47,405
Trust me.

1762
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,279
Ooh.

1763
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,515
I got you.
