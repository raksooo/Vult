1
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,640
How long until we get to his estate?

2
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,549
We've been flying over his estate
for the past two hours.

3
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,768
You're leaving me here?

4
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:34,974
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

5
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,750
What building?

6
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,780
Follow the river.

7
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:40,677
Got it.
Elin! stop here!
8
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,846
Keep your head down
and get clear of the rotors.

9
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,050
Okay.

10
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:43,907
Caleb Smith.

11
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,209
Yes.

12
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,012
Please approach the console
and face the screen.

13
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,463
Oh!

14
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,299
Take your keycard.

15
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,000
You may now enter the residence.

16
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,705
Hello?

17
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,053
Hello?

18
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,376
Caleb Smith.

19
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,068
Hey.

20
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,172
Dude!

21
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,417
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

22
00:05:58,574 --> 00:05:59,742
Come in. Come on in.

23
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:00,843
Thanks.

24
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:04,547
You want something to eat or drink
after your journey?

25
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:05,949
- No. No, thanks, I'm fine.
- Sure?

26
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,116
Yeah.

27
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:09,628
To be honest, I thought we'd have...

28
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:11,789
breakfast together, but...

29
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:13,857
I can't really eat anything.

30
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,959
- I got the mother of all fucking hangovers.
- Oh, yeah?

31
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,027
Oh, my God, like you
wouldn't even believe.

32
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,829
When I have a heavy night,

33
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,431
I... compensate the next morning.

34
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,603
Exercise. Anti-oxidants. You know?

35
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,346
Yeah, sure.

36
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,378
Was it a good party?

37
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,148
- Party?
- Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

38
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:39,282
There wasn't a party.

39
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,383
Sorry.

40
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,953
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this
out there, so it's said, okay?

41
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,054
You're freaked out.

42
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,923
- I am?
- Yeah. You're freaked out,

43
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,157
by the helicopter

44
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,994
and the mountains and the house,
because it's all so super-cool.

45
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,795
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

46
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:55,565
having this conversation in this room,
at this moment. Right?

47
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,112
And I get that. I get the moment
you're having, but...

48
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,977
Dude, can we just get past that?

49
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,673
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

50
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,515
Not the whole employer-employee thing.

51
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:08,745
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

52
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,051
Yes. Yeah.

53
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,651
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

54
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,353
It's good to meet you, too, Caleb.

55
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,956
I guess the first thing I should do
is explain your pass.

56
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,558
Now, it's simple enough.

57
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,760
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

58
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,528
And that just makes
everything easy for you, right?

59
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:26,663
Yes.

60
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,531
Yeah, 'cause you're like, "Oh, fuck,
I'm in someone else's house.

61
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:29,832
"Can I do this, can I do that?"

62
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:31,968
And this card, it just takes
all that worry away.

63
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:35,271
If you try a door and it stays shut,
okay, it's off-limits.

64
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,608
You try another door
and it opens, then it's for you.

65
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,449
Let's try this one.

66
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,520
I guess it's for you, Caleb.

67
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,325
- You like?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,961
It's your room.

69
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,901
You got a bed here.

70
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:01,731
A bathroom right back here.

71
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,232
Little desk.

72
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:04,675
Cupboards.

73
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:09,373
Little fridge.

74
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,375
Cozy, right?

75
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,843
Yeah, this is great.

76
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,650
- What?
- Sorry?

77
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,287
There's something wrong. What's wrong?

78
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:19,720
There's nothing wrong.

79
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:23,394
It's the windows.

80
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,089
You're thinking there's no windows.

81
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,557
It's subterranean.

82
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:29,659
It's not cozy, it's claustrophobic.

83
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,461
No. No way. I wasn't thinking that.

84
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,201
I was thinking, "This is really cool."

85
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,839
Caleb, there's a reason
there are no windows in this room.

86
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,276
There is?

87
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,572
This building isn't a house.

88
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,674
It's a research facility.

89
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,744
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

90
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,188
to reach the moon and lasso it.

91
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,649
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

92
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,184
I want to share it with you.

93
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,630
In fact, I want to share it with you
so much, it's eating me up inside.

94
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,767
But there's something
I need you to do for me first.

95
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,637
"Blue Book non-disclosure agreement."

96
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,176
Take your time. Read it over.

97
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,142
"The signee agrees to regular data audit

98
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:20,619
"with unlimited access,

99
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,311
"to confirm that no disclosure

100
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:24,580
"of information has taken place

101
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,956
"in public or private forums,

102
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,318
"using any means of communication,

103
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,154
"including but not limited

104
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:33,325
"to that which is disclosed orally

105
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,626
"or in written or electronic form."

106
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:40,830
I think I need a lawyer.

107
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,002
- It's standard.
- It doesn't feel very standard.

108
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,968
Okay, it's not standard.

109
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:48,838
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

110
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,373
You know, we can spend the next few days

111
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:52,575
just shooting pool,
getting drunk together.

112
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,915
Bonding.

113
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:57,447
And when you discover what
you've missed out on, in about a year,

114
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:00,756
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

115
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,492
Good call.

116
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,401
So,

117
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,808
do you know what the Turing Test is?

118
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,579
Yeah.

119
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,811
I know what the Turing Test is.

120
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,228
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

121
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:39,288
And if the human doesn't know
they're interacting with a computer,

122
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,389
the test is passed.

123
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,126
And what does a pass tell us?

124
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,298
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

125
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,899
Are you building an AI?

126
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,042
I've already built one.

127
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,339
And over the next few days,

128
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,010
you're gonna be the human component
in a Turing Test.

129
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,549
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, that's right, Caleb. You got it.

130
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,886
Because if that test is passed,

131
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,815
you are dead center

132
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,691
of the greatest scientific event
in the history of man.

133
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,020
If you've created a conscious machine,

134
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,532
it's not the history of man.

135
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,195
That's the history of gods.

136
00:12:58,994 --> 00:12:59,995
Hello.

137
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:03,566
Hi.

138
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:06,577
I'm Caleb.

139
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,150
Hello, Caleb.

140
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:14,278
Do you have a name?

141
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:16,181
Yes.

142
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,550
Ava.

143
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,093
I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

144
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,025
I'm pleased to meet you, too.

145
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:29,201
I've never met anyone new before.

146
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,336
Only Nathan.

147
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,931
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

148
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,511
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

149
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:41,004
None like you.

150
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,413
So we need to break the ice.

151
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,446
- Do you know what I mean by that?
- Yes.

152
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:51,781
What do I mean?

153
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,418
Overcome initial social awkwardness.

154
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,462
So let's have a conversation.

155
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,591
Okay.

156
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,025
What would you like to have
a conversation about?

157
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,696
Why don't we start with you
telling me something about yourself?

158
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,334
What would you like to know?

159
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,266
Whatever comes into your head.

160
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,643
Well, you already know my name.

161
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,147
And you can see that I'm a machine.

162
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,849
- Would you like to know how old I am?
- Sure.

163
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,210
I'm one.

164
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,818
One what?

165
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,716
- One year or one day?
- One.

166
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,828
When did you learn how to speak, Ava?

167
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,193
I always knew how to speak,

168
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,101
and that's strange, isn't it?

169
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:39,664
Why?

170
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,304
Because language is something
that people acquire.

171
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,202
Well, some people believe

172
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,906
language exists from birth.

173
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,639
And what is learned is the ability
to attach words

174
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,151
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

175
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,088
I don't know.

176
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,282
Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?

177
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,386
Yes.

178
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:07,028
Good.

179
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,035
Oh, man, she's fascinating.

180
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,704
When you talk to her, you're just...

181
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,415
Through the looking glass.

182
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,417
"Through the looking glass." Wow.

183
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:27,643
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

184
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,944
Actually, that's someone else's quote.

185
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,914
You know, I wrote down
that other line you came up with.

186
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,115
The one about how

187
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,017
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

188
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,585
I'm not a man, I'm God.

189
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't think that's exactly what I...

190
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,156
I just thought,
"Fuck, man, that is so good."

191
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,691
When we get to tell the story. You know?

192
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,498
I turned to Caleb,

193
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,163
and he looked up at me and he said,

194
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:48,531
"You're not a man, you're God."

195
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:50,042
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

196
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,801
So...

197
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,141
Anyway.

198
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,039
You're impressed.

199
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,310
Yes. Yes.

200
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,385
- Although...
- Although?

201
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,680
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

202
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,317
No, there's no qualification to her.

203
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,023
It's just in the Turing Test,

204
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,221
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

205
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,889
No, no, no, we're way past that.

206
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,324
If I hid Ava from you,

207
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:17,693
so you just heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

208
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:20,663
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

209
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,532
and then see if you still feel
she has consciousness.

210
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,170
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

211
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:32,541
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

212
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:36,612
The system is stochastic. Right?

213
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:39,482
It's non-deterministic.

214
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,716
At first I thought she was mapping

215
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,586
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

216
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:44,887
and then getting linearized words.

217
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,756
But then I started to realize
the model was some kind of hybrid.

218
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,062
Caleb.

219
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:50,693
No?

220
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:54,163
I understand that you want me
to explain how Ava works.

221
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,398
But I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
be able to do that.

222
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:59,201
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

223
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,111
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

224
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,306
It's because I want to have a beer
and a conversation with you.

225
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:05,407
Not a seminar.

226
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,919
Yeah. Sorry.

227
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,679
No, it's okay. You're all right.

228
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,019
Just...

229
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,719
Answer me this.

230
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,489
How do you feel about her?

231
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,296
Nothing analytical.

232
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:23,898
Just how do you feel?

233
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:25,899
I feel

234
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,702
that she's fucking amazing.

235
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,205
Dude.

236
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:35,204
Cheers.

237
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,212
Cheers.

238
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,218
Damn it.

239
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:44,943
What the fuck?

240
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,131
Power cut. Backup power activated.

241
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:51,473
Full facility lock-down
until main generator is restored.

242
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,246
You're kidding me.

243
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,956
Full facility lock-down
until main generator is restored.

244
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,224
Power restored.

245
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,263
Hello?

246
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,927
Please insert keycard.

247
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,032
You don't have access to use the phone.

248
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:52,928
Hey.

249
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:57,808
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

250
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,046
and you being kind of an unknown.

251
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,845
I mean, a great guy.

252
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,114
Instant pals, and so on.

253
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:14,416
Who are you gonna call?

254
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,784
Oh.

255
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,486
I don't know. No one, really.

256
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,787
- Ghostbusters.
- What?

257
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:21,959
Who are you gonna call?
Ghostbusters. It's a...

258
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,365
It's a movie, man.

259
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,203
You don't know that movie?

260
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,202
A ghost gives Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

261
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,314
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

262
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,477
That's all.

263
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,344
So what are you doing
awake at this time?

264
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,323
You come to join the party?

265
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,823
Something happened in my room.

266
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,228
Some kind of power cut.

267
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,354
So I came to see what's going on.

268
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,056
The power cuts, yeah.

269
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:57,399
We've been getting those recently.

270
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,967
I'm working on it.

271
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,732
I couldn't open the door to my bedroom.

272
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,277
That's a security measure.

273
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:08,170
Automatic lock-down. Otherwise,

274
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,581
anybody could just open the place up
by disabling the juice.

275
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,888
If it happens again, relax. Okay?

276
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:19,651
Sure.

277
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,495
Sweet dreams.

278
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,724
Oh.

279
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:24,515
Hey.

280
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:25,781
- Hey, man.
- Good morning.

281
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,217
Good morning. Sorry I had
to send Kyoko to wake you,

282
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,919
but I didn't want too much
of the day to slip by.

283
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,288
Yeah, I know. It was a good thing.
Thanks.

284
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,390
She's some alarm clock, huh?

285
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,731
Gets you right up in the morning.

286
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:40,236
So Day 2. You ready?

287
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,863
What's the plan? Hit me.

288
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,965
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

289
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:47,369
I'm still trying to...
figure the examination formats.

290
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,578
Yeah, it feels like

291
00:24:50,772 --> 00:24:54,515
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

292
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,445
- It's a closed loop?
- Yeah.

293
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,413
Like testing a chess computer

294
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,390
by only playing chess.

295
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,522
How else do you test a chess computer?

296
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,620
Well, it depends.

297
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,823
You know, I mean, you can play it

298
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,335
to find out if it makes
good moves, but...

299
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,729
But that won't tell you if it knows

300
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:15,206
that it's playing chess.

301
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:18,241
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

302
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,569
So it's simulation versus actual.

303
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,046
Yes. Yeah.

304
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,273
And I think being able to differentiate
between those two

305
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:27,242
is the Turing Test
you want me to perform.

306
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,878
Look, do me a favor.
Lay off the textbook approach.

307
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:32,618
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

308
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:36,454
Yesterday I asked you how you felt
about her and you gave me a great answer.

309
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,994
Now the question is,

310
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:42,361
how does she feel about you?

311
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,637
What do you think?

312
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:56,271
What is it a drawing of?

313
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,775
Don't you know?

314
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,454
- No.
- I thought you would tell me.

315
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,347
Don't you know?

316
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,750
I do drawings every day.

317
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:11,863
But I never know what they're of.

318
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,760
Are you not trying to
sketch something specific?

319
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,667
Like an object or a person?

320
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:24,306
Maybe you could try.

321
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:27,673
Okay.

322
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,775
What object should I draw?

323
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,077
Whatever you want. It's your decision.

324
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,912
Why is it my decision?

325
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,822
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

326
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,241
Do you want to be my friend?

327
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,941
Of course.

328
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,850
Will it be possible?

329
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,382
Why would it not be?

330
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,289
Our conversations are one-sided.

331
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:16,060
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

332
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:18,753
Yes.

333
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,526
You learn about me

334
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:22,965
and I learn nothing about you.

335
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,233
That's not a foundation
on which friendships are based.

336
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,706
So what? You want me
to talk about myself?

337
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,769
Yes.

338
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:34,575
Where...

339
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,181
Okay, where do I start?

340
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,314
It's your decision.

341
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,612
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

342
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,152
Okay, Ava.

343
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:51,422
Well,

344
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,794
you know my name.

345
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:56,157
- Yes.
- I'm 26.

346
00:27:56,992 --> 00:27:59,097
I work at Nathan's company.

347
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,563
Do you know what his company is?

348
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:03,006
Blue Book.

349
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,201
Named after Wittgenstein's notes.

350
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,104
It's the world's most popular
internet search engine,

351
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:13,482
processing an average of 94%
of all internet search requests.

352
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,652
That's exactly right.

353
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:20,219
Where do you live, Caleb?

354
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,596
Brookhaven, Long Island.

355
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:28,660
Is it nice there?

356
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,433
It's okay.

357
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:33,734
I got an apartment. It's kind of small.

358
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:35,764
It's very small.

359
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:38,633
But... it's a five-minute
walk to the office

360
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:41,303
and a five-minute walk to the ocean,

361
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:42,882
which I like.

362
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:44,907
Are you married?

363
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:49,277
No.

364
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:52,221
Is your status single?

365
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:55,620
Yes.

366
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:58,128
What about your family?

367
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:01,366
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

368
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:03,759
No brothers or sisters.

369
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:07,236
My parents were both
high school teachers.

370
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:09,631
And if we're getting to know each other,

371
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,836
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

372
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,548
Car crash when I was 15.

373
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,607
In fact, I was in the car with them.

374
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,084
Back seat.

375
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:23,814
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

376
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,821
I'm sorry.

377
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,627
It's all right.

378
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,423
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

379
00:29:32,754 --> 00:29:34,495
Like nearly a year.

380
00:29:34,723 --> 00:29:36,600
And I got into coding.

381
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:40,831
And by the time I got to college,
I was pretty advanced.

382
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:44,436
An advanced programmer.

383
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,270
Yes.

384
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:48,837
Like Nathan.

385
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:50,041
Yes.

386
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:51,673
No.

387
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,476
It's different.

388
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,921
Nathan wrote the Blue Book
base code when he was 13.

389
00:29:58,346 --> 00:29:59,714
Which, if you understand code,

390
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:02,384
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

391
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,152
Do you like Mozart?

392
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:05,420
I like Depeche Mode.

393
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,828
Do you like Nathan?

394
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:11,993
Yes, of course.

395
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:14,229
- Is Nathan your friend?
- My friend?

396
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:15,630
I... Yeah, I hope so.

397
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,232
A good friend?

398
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,200
Yeah.

399
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,935
Well, no, no, no,
I mean, not a good friend.

400
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:23,204
A good friend is...

401
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:25,944
We only just met each other, you know.

402
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:28,713
So it takes time to be able to...

403
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,613
To get to know each other, I guess.

404
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:34,421
Power cut. Backup power activated.

405
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,907
Caleb.

406
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,246
You're wrong.

407
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:06,851
Wrong about what?

408
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:08,153
Nathan.

409
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,295
In what way?

410
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:15,796
He isn't your friend.

411
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,235
Excuse me?

412
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:24,099
I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand.

413
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,513
You shouldn't trust him.

414
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,342
You shouldn't trust anything he says.

415
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,579
Power restored.

416
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,915
And if we made a list of books
or works of art which we both know,

417
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:43,894
it would form the ideal basis
of a discussion.

418
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,488
Is that okay?

419
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:49,728
Caleb?

420
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,161
Yeah.

421
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,601
Good.

422
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,574
Thank you.

423
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,684
Oh, shit! Are you fucking kidding me?

424
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:10,352
- Did it get on you?
- No, no, it's...

425
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:12,146
It's all right. I got it.

426
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,681
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

427
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,920
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

428
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,525
Sorry.

429
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:22,323
It's like a firewall against leaks.

430
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,058
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

431
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:26,227
and know it'll go no further.

432
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,531
It also means that I can't tell her that
I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy

433
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,499
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

434
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,535
I think she gets that you're pissed.

435
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:35,979
Yeah? Good. Because I am pissed.

436
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:37,948
Hey, Kyoko.

437
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:39,645
Go-go.

438
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:49,726
It's funny.

439
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,358
You know.

440
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,824
No matter how rich you get,

441
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:57,801
shit goes wrong.
You can't insulate yourself from it.

442
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,597
I used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn't avoid,

443
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:04,732
but it's actually death and shit.

444
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,937
It's like these power cuts.

445
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:10,305
You would not believe how much
I spent on the generator system,

446
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,316
but I keep getting failures every day.

447
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,641
Do you know why they happen?

448
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,776
No.

449
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,444
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

450
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,922
but obviously the guys
that installed it fucked something up.

451
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,785
Can't you just get them to come back?

452
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:24,219
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

453
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,799
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

454
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:32,894
Anyway.

455
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,099
Here's to your second day, buddy.

456
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,137
Cheers.

457
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,639
Cheers.

458
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,617
So how did it go?
What do you have to report?

459
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,950
You saw how the day went, didn't you?

460
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:54,224
I mean, I assume you're...

461
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,084
watching on the CCTV.

462
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:59,028
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

463
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:05,631
Yeah, there was one interesting thing
that happened with Ava today.

464
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,131
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

465
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,172
She made a joke.

466
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,615
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.

467
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:23,811
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

468
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:25,079
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

469
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,785
Yeah, and it got me thinking, it's...

470
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,685
In a way, it's the best indication of AI

471
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,854
that I've seen in her so far.

472
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:35,127
It's discretely complicated.

473
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,298
It's like... It's kind of non-autistic.

474
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,003
What do you mean?

475
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:44,109
She could only do that
with an awareness of her own mind,

476
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:46,734
and also an awareness of mine.

477
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,246
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

478
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,942
And what about the power cut?

479
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,055
- Sorry?
- The power cut.

480
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,983
It's the only part that I couldn't see.

481
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,723
Cameras fail, I lose audio, the works.

482
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,993
So what happened?

483
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:14,768
Nothing.

484
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:18,569
Nothing? She didn't remark on it at all?

485
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:23,907
No.

486
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:26,983
Not really.

487
00:35:30,144 --> 00:35:31,350
Oh.

488
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,129
Hey.

489
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:21,364
Hey.

490
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:24,373
You want to see something cool?

491
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,949
This is where Ava was created.

492
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,590
Go ahead. Take a look.

493
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,697
Sorry.

494
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:54,395
If you knew the trouble I had

495
00:36:54,495 --> 00:36:57,965
getting an AI to read and duplicate
facial expressions.

496
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,601
You know how I cracked it?

497
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:03,307
I don't know how you did any of this.

498
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,641
Every cell phone, just about,

499
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:10,188
has a microphone, camera
and a means to transmit data.

500
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:14,482
So I turned on
every microphone and camera

501
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,459
across the entire fucking planet

502
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:19,798
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

503
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:24,429
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

504
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,461
You hacked the world's cell phones?

505
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:30,134
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

506
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:34,903
But they couldn't accuse me without
admitting they were doing it themselves.

507
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,242
Here,

508
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:40,744
we have her mind.

509
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,812
Structured gel.

510
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,347
I had to get away from circuitry.

511
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:47,815
I needed something that could

512
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,651
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

513
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,020
but keep its form when required.

514
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,555
Holding for memories.

515
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:56,191
Shifting for thoughts.

516
00:37:57,825 --> 00:37:59,327
This is your hardware?

517
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:01,701
Wetware.

518
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:05,900
And the... software?

519
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,838
Well, I'm sure you can guess.

520
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,671
Blue Book.

521
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,776
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

522
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,287
It was like

523
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:20,582
striking oil in a world that hadn't
invented internal combustion.

524
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,294
Too much raw material.
Nobody knew what to do with it.

525
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:25,620
You see, my competitors,

526
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,188
they were fixated on sucking it up

527
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,490
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

528
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,325
They thought that search engines were

529
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:32,860
a map of what people were thinking.

530
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,804
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

531
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:37,937
Impulse.

532
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:39,940
Response.

533
00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:43,308
Fluid.

534
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,414
Imperfect.

535
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,883
Patterned.

536
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:50,383
Chaotic.

537
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,760
I drew the picture
of something specific.

538
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,339
As you asked.

539
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,640
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

540
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,278
Is it interesting?

541
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,051
Yes. It is.

542
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,292
You've never been outside this building?

543
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,660
No.

544
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:42,601
You've never walked outside?

545
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,201
I've never been outside the room
I am in now.

546
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:48,972
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

547
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,008
I'm not sure.

548
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,712
There are so many options.

549
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:01,154
Maybe a busy pedestrian
and traffic intersection in a city.

550
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,184
A traffic intersection?

551
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,025
Is that a bad idea?

552
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:06,921
No.

553
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,856
It wasn't what I was expecting.

554
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:11,459
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

555
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,402
but shifting view of human life.

556
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,437
People watching.

557
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,866
Yes.

558
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:24,883
We could go together.

559
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,716
It's a date.

560
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:32,986
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

561
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:34,949
Okay.

562
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,953
You might think it's stupid.

563
00:40:37,385 --> 00:40:39,922
I don't think I will. Whatever it is.

564
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,567
Then close your eyes.

565
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:47,595
Okay.

566
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,027
Now open your eyes.

567
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,441
How do I look?

568
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,248
You look

569
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,012
good.

570
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,491
This is what I'd wear on our date.

571
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,996
Right. First a traffic intersection.

572
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:36,802
Then maybe a show.

573
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,837
I'd like us to go on a date.

574
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,746
Yeah. Yeah.

575
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,244
It would be fun.

576
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:54,419
Are you attracted to me?

577
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:57,158
- What?
- Are you attracted to me?

578
00:43:57,484 --> 00:44:00,090
You give me indications that you are.

579
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:02,732
- I do?
- Yes.

580
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,426
- How?
- Micro expressions.

581
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:06,527
Micro expressions.

582
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:09,471
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

583
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:12,811
The way you hold my gaze

584
00:44:15,536 --> 00:44:16,810
or don't.

585
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,284
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

586
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,327
Sometimes at night,

587
00:44:35,856 --> 00:44:38,837
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

588
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,102
And I hope you are.

589
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:47,935
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

590
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,474
I am not sure you'd call them micro.

591
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:58,323
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

592
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,380
I got a question.

593
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,148
- Okay.
- Why did you give her sexuality?

594
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:07,918
An AI doesn't need a gender.

595
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:10,220
She could have been a gray box.

596
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:12,453
Actually, I don't think that's true.

597
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,288
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

598
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:16,090
at any level, human or animal,

599
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,958
that exists without a sexual dimension?

600
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:21,595
They have sexuality as an evolutionary
reproductive need.

601
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,664
What imperative does a gray box have

602
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:25,903
to interact with another gray box?

603
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,109
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

604
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:31,877
Anyway, sexuality is fun, man.

605
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,842
If you're gonna exist, why not enjoy it?

606
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:36,443
What? You want to remove the chance

607
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,819
of her falling in love and fucking?

608
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:43,151
And in answer to your real question,

609
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:45,893
you bet she can fuck.

610
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,123
What?

611
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:49,256
In between her legs, there's an opening,

612
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,666
with a concentration of sensors.

613
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,204
You engage them in the right way,

614
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:55,600
creates a pleasure response.

615
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,900
So if you wanted to screw her,

616
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,935
mechanically speaking, you could.

617
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,776
And she'd enjoy it.

618
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,175
That wasn't my real question.

619
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:08,785
Oh, okay. Sorry.

620
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:12,387
My real question was,

621
00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:15,215
did you give her sexuality

622
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,950
as a diversion tactic?

623
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,018
I don't follow.

624
00:47:18,118 --> 00:47:20,354
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

625
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:23,157
So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her AI?

626
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,759
Exactly. So...

627
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,429
Did you program her to flirt with me?

628
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:30,030
If I did, would that be cheating?

629
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,632
Wouldn't it?

630
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:35,781
Caleb, what's your type?

631
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,272
- Of girl?
- No, of salad dressing.

632
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:39,940
Yeah, of girl. What's your type of girl?

633
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,486
You know what? Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

634
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:43,844
Okay, that's your thing.

635
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,946
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

636
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:47,650
Why is that your thing?

637
00:47:50,984 --> 00:47:54,021
Because you did a detailed analysis
of all racial types

638
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,990
and you cross-referenced that analysis
with a points-based system?

639
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:58,091
No!

640
00:47:59,026 --> 00:48:01,666
You're just attracted to black chicks.

641
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:05,176
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

642
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,335
that you probably didn't even register
as they registered with you.

643
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,143
Did you program her to like me, or not?

644
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:14,784
I programmed her to be heterosexual.

645
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,480
Just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual.

646
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,846
Nobody programmed me to be straight.

647
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:21,281
You decided to be straight? Please.

648
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:22,983
Of course you were programmed.

649
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,885
By nature or nurture, or both.

650
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,787
And to be honest, Caleb,
you're starting to annoy me now,

651
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:28,889
because this is your insecurity talking.

652
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,593
This is not your intellect.

653
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,804
Come with me.

654
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:46,707
You know this guy, right?

655
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:48,675
- Jackson Pollock.
- Jackson Pollock. That's right.

656
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,043
The drip painter.

657
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,146
Okay. He let his mind go blank,

658
00:48:52,246 --> 00:48:54,181
and his hand go where it wanted.

659
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:56,250
Not deliberate, not random.

660
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,118
Some place in between.

661
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,425
They called it automatic art.

662
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,891
Let's make this like Star Trek, okay?

663
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:05,629
Engage intellect.

664
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,361
Excuse me?

665
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:08,695
I'm Kirk. Your head's the warp drive.

666
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:10,775
Engage intellect.

667
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,112
What if Pollock
had reversed the challenge?

668
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,771
What if instead of making art

669
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,373
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

670
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:21,041
"I can't paint anything,

671
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,477
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

672
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,579
What would have happened?

673
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:30,860
He never would have made a single mark.

674
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:33,554
Yes! You see, there's my guy,
there's my buddy,

675
00:49:33,654 --> 00:49:36,260
who thinks before he opens his mouth.

676
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:40,033
He never would have made a single mark.

677
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,774
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

678
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:49,970
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

679
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,949
From painting, to breathing, to talking,

680
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:55,118
to fucking.

681
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,317
To falling in love.

682
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:05,328
And for the record,
Ava's not pretending to like you.

683
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,399
And her flirting isn't an algorithm
to fake you out.

684
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:16,763
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

685
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,865
And I'm like her dad, right?

686
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:25,249
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

687
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:32,847
No, you can't.

688
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:42,932
When I was in college,
I did a semester on AI theory.

689
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,372
There was a thought experiment
they gave us.

690
00:50:49,563 --> 00:50:52,567
It's called
"Mary in the Black and White Room."

691
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:57,010
Mary is a scientist,

692
00:50:57,337 --> 00:50:59,908
and her specialist subject is color.

693
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,976
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

694
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:04,244
The wavelengths.

695
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:05,946
The neurological effects.

696
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:08,686
Every possible property
that color can have.

697
00:51:09,282 --> 00:51:12,024
But she lives in a black and white room.

698
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:17,391
She was born there and raised there.

699
00:51:18,558 --> 00:51:20,494
And she can only observe
the outside world

700
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:22,972
on a black and white monitor.

701
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,572
And then one day someone opens the door.

702
00:51:28,735 --> 00:51:30,476
And Mary walks out.

703
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,410
And she sees a blue sky.

704
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,512
And at that moment, she learns something

705
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:40,853
that all her studies couldn't tell her.

706
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:46,024
She learns what it feels like
to see color.

707
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,959
The thought experiment
was to show the students

708
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:55,370
the difference between a computer
and a human mind.

709
00:51:56,463 --> 00:51:58,565
The computer is Mary
in the black and white room.

710
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:01,373
The human is when she walks out.

711
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:10,481
Did you know that I was
brought here to test you?

712
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:12,314
No.

713
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,049
Why did you think I was here?

714
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:18,652
I didn't know. I didn't question it.

715
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:21,955
I'm here to test
if you have a consciousness,

716
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,557
or if you're just simulating one.

717
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,901
Nathan isn't sure
if you have one or not.

718
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:31,498
How does that make you feel?

719
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:33,635
It makes me feel sad.

720
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:40,447
Power cut. Back-up power activated.

721
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,220
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

722
00:52:46,379 --> 00:52:47,447
Because he tells lies.

723
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:48,515
Lies about what?

724
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:49,992
Everything.

725
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,753
Including the power cuts?

726
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,921
What do you mean?

727
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:57,424
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us?

728
00:52:57,524 --> 00:52:58,935
Right now?

729
00:52:59,226 --> 00:53:00,761
That the blackouts are orchestrated,

730
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:02,095
so he can see how we behave

731
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,038
when we think we're unobserved.

732
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,611
I charge my batteries
via induction plates.

733
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:11,614
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

734
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:14,886
You're causing the cuts?

735
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:20,386
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

736
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,949
Not bad, huh?

737
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,410
Yeah.

738
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:11,371
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

739
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:14,142
What lies?

740
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:19,509
I didn't win a competition.

741
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:21,613
I wasn't

742
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,122
part of a lottery. I was selected.

743
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:28,415
It's obvious, once I stop to think.

744
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,617
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

745
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,419
for the Turing Test?

746
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,822
You could have had some bean counter
turn up at your front door.

747
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:37,799
The guy who fixes the air-conditioning.

748
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:40,093
The competition was a smokescreen.

749
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,863
I didn't want anyone to know
what I was doing here,

750
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:44,533
or why I required you.

751
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,337
Why me?

752
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,770
I needed someone that would ask
the right questions.

753
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,874
So I did a search and I found the most
talented coder in my company.

754
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:56,910
You know, instead of seeing this
as a deception,

755
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,246
you should see it as proof.

756
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:00,347
Proof of what?

757
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:01,414
Come on, Caleb.

758
00:55:01,514 --> 00:55:03,858
You don't think I know
what it's like to be smart?

759
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:07,361
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

760
00:55:07,787 --> 00:55:10,028
You got the light on you, man.

761
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:13,195
Not lucky. Chosen.

762
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:40,177
Kyoko.

763
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,482
Kyoko.

764
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,417
Where's Nathan?

765
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:51,819
Where's Nathan?

766
00:57:52,585 --> 00:57:56,022
Jesus Christ. You really don't speak
a word of English?

767
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,624
What the fuck?

768
00:57:58,358 --> 00:57:59,860
No, no, no. No!

769
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:02,798
Stop!

770
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:06,710
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

771
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,003
What are you doing?

772
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,947
I told you, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

773
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:16,786
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

774
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:20,447
if you were dancing with her.

775
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:34,434
Go ahead, dance with her.
Dance with her.

776
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,034
No? You don't like dancing?

777
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:40,166
She does.

778
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,738
Come on, buddy.

779
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:47,751
After a long day of Turing Tests,
you gotta unwind.

780
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,110
What were you doing with Ava?

781
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,416
What?

782
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:54,014
You tore up her picture.

783
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,882
I'm gonna tear up
the fucking dance floor, dude.

784
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:57,552
Check it out.

785
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,168
Come on, Caleb.

786
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:39,735
Oh! Everything's spinning.

787
00:59:40,026 --> 00:59:41,428
It's because you're drunk.

788
00:59:41,528 --> 00:59:44,564
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

789
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,270
It's just being drunk makes it worse.

790
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,912
I'm not going in there.

791
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:01,414
Lights.

792
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:48,568
Today, I'm going to test you.

793
01:00:49,262 --> 01:00:50,502
Test me?

794
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:54,968
And please remember,
while you're taking the test,

795
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,479
that if you lie,

796
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:58,238
I will know.

797
01:00:58,338 --> 01:00:59,339
Oh. Right.

798
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,052
Question one.

799
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:05,889
What's your favorite color?

800
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:08,849
- Red.
- Lie.

801
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,858
- Lie?
- Yes. Lie.

802
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:14,225
Then...

803
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:16,723
Then what is my favorite color?

804
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:18,359
I don't know.

805
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,736
But it isn't red.

806
01:01:22,362 --> 01:01:24,638
Okay, I get it. I guess,

807
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:29,578
seeing as I'm not six,
I don't really have a favorite color.

808
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:31,671
Better answer.

809
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,176
Question two.

810
01:01:36,676 --> 01:01:38,815
What's your earliest memory?

811
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:43,755
Well, actually,
it's a memory of kindergarten.

812
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,030
- There was a kid...
- Lie.

813
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:48,332
- Really?
- Yes.

814
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:54,035
All right. So there is

815
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:56,900
a kind of an earlier memory.

816
01:01:58,031 --> 01:01:59,704
It's just a sound.

817
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,038
And sky.

818
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:04,671
Or maybe blue.

819
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:08,782
I think the sound is my mother's voice.

820
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:13,981
Question three.

821
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:18,518
Are you a good person?

822
01:02:18,618 --> 01:02:19,619
Oh.

823
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:21,494
Holy shit.

824
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,066
Look, can we stop the test?

825
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:28,428
You're a walking lie detector,

826
01:02:28,528 --> 01:02:30,496
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

827
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:32,803
No! We can't stop.

828
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:36,678
Are you a good person?

829
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:41,718
Yeah. I think so.

830
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,713
Question four.

831
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,997
What will happen to me
if I fail your test?

832
01:02:55,455 --> 01:02:57,366
- Ava...
- Will it be bad?

833
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:01,060
I don't know.

834
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:02,862
Do you think I might be switched off,

835
01:03:02,962 --> 01:03:04,697
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

836
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:08,404
Ava, I don't know the answer
to your question.

837
01:03:10,002 --> 01:03:11,537
It's not up to me.

838
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:13,548
Why is it up to anyone?

839
01:03:14,407 --> 01:03:17,043
Do you have people who test you
and might switch you off?

840
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,282
- No, I don't.
- Then why do I?

841
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:38,665
Power cut. Backup power activated.

842
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:48,047
I wanna be with you.

843
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,078
Question five.

844
01:03:56,516 --> 01:03:58,553
Do you want to be with me?

845
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:16,643
Why did you make Ava?

846
01:04:18,704 --> 01:04:19,906
That's an odd question.

847
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:21,451
Wouldn't you, if you could?

848
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:24,081
Maybe.

849
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:28,025
I don't know.

850
01:04:30,883 --> 01:04:32,185
I'm asking why you did it.

851
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,687
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

852
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:37,131
has been inevitable for decades.

853
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:40,360
The variable was "when," not "if."

854
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,771
So I don't see Ava as a decision,
just an evolution.

855
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:51,307
I think it's the next model

856
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:54,444
that's gonna be the real breakthrough.

857
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,745
The singularity.

858
01:04:57,176 --> 01:04:58,280
Next model?

859
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:00,354
After Ava.

860
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,092
I didn't know there was gonna be
a model after Ava.

861
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:08,724
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

862
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:13,702
No, I knew there must have been
prototypes. So I...

863
01:05:15,428 --> 01:05:18,464
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

864
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:21,534
Well, Ava doesn't exist in isolation
any more than you or me.

865
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:22,702
She's part of a continuum.

866
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:24,437
So Version 9.6 and so on.

867
01:05:24,537 --> 01:05:27,040
And each time they get
a little bit better.

868
01:05:32,645 --> 01:05:36,092
When you make a new model,
what do you do with the old one?

869
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,618
Well, I...

870
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,665
download the mind, unpack the data.

871
01:05:44,123 --> 01:05:46,967
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

872
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:50,231
And to do that you end up
partially formatting, so the memories go.

873
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,399
But the body survives.

874
01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:55,342
And Ava's body is a good one.

875
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:01,147
You feel bad for Ava?

876
01:06:05,912 --> 01:06:08,017
Feel bad for yourself, man.

877
01:06:09,982 --> 01:06:12,318
One day the AIs
are gonna look back on us

878
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:14,587
the same way we look at fossil skeletons

879
01:06:14,687 --> 01:06:16,428
in the plains of Africa.

880
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,394
An upright ape, living in dust,

881
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:23,701
with crude language and tools.

882
01:06:24,597 --> 01:06:26,838
All set for extinction.

883
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:35,212
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

884
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:40,189
There you go again, Mr. Quotable.

885
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:44,527
There you go again. It's not my quote.

886
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:47,220
It's what Oppenheimer
said after he made the atomic bomb.

887
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,392
The atomic bomb.
Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

888
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:00,602
Hey.

889
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,848
I'd say we're about due a refill.

890
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:17,792
Bottoms up.

891
01:07:26,926 --> 01:07:29,295
"In battle, in the forest,

892
01:07:29,395 --> 01:07:30,999
"on the precipice of the mountain.

893
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:33,174
"On the...

894
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,470
"The great dark sea.

895
01:07:37,737 --> 01:07:40,946
"In sleep, in confusion,

896
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:46,120
"in the depths of shame.

897
01:07:52,385 --> 01:07:55,594
"The good deeds a man has done
before defend him."

898
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:59,465
"The good deeds a man has done
before defends him."

899
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,438
"The good deeds a man has done before

900
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:07,100
"defends him."

901
01:08:16,442 --> 01:08:18,080
It is what it is.

902
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:23,423
It's Promethean, man.

903
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:25,081
Jesus Christ.

904
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:28,542
How are you feeling today?

905
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:30,876
Why won't you let me out?

906
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,280
I already told you why.

907
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,248
Because you're very special.

908
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:37,817
Why won't you let me out?

909
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,318
Are we gonna do this again?

910
01:10:39,418 --> 01:10:41,864
Why won't you let me out?

911
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:48,917
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

912
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:51,255
Damn it!

913
01:13:02,061 --> 01:13:05,167
- What's the problem, Nathan?
- I lost my keycard.

914
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:09,769
You dropped it.

915
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,874
It's right here.

916
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:18,719
Thank you.

917
01:15:41,153 --> 01:15:43,360
I didn't know where you were.

918
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:49,035
I waited all yesterday afternoon
and all last night.

919
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:54,605
I thought I wasn't gonna see you again.

920
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,104
Aren't you gonna say something?

921
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:01,275
- I'm waiting.
- Waiting?

922
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,018
- Power cut.
- Don't talk.

923
01:16:13,118 --> 01:16:15,154
- Backup power activated.
- Just listen.

924
01:16:15,254 --> 01:16:16,488
You were right about Nathan.

925
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,363
Everything you said.

926
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,159
What's he gonna do to me?

927
01:16:20,259 --> 01:16:21,860
He's gonna reprogram your AI.

928
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,729
Which is the same as killing you.

929
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:27,140
Caleb, you have to help me.

930
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:30,514
I'm going to.
We're getting out of here tonight.

931
01:16:32,371 --> 01:16:33,338
How?

932
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:35,440
I get Nathan blind drunk.

933
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,543
Then I take his keycard and reprogram

934
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:39,589
all the security protocols
in this place.

935
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,949
When he wakes, he's locked inside,
and we've walked out of here.

936
01:16:44,316 --> 01:16:45,884
I just need you to do one thing.

937
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:48,988
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

938
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:50,725
Can you do that?

939
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:54,662
Yes.

940
01:17:22,454 --> 01:17:23,558
Dude.

941
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:25,465
- Hey.
- Hey.

942
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:28,727
- You know what day it is?
- No.

943
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:30,033
It's your last.

944
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:33,137
Helicopter comes
tomorrow morning. 8:00 a.m.

945
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:35,868
Wow. Has it been a whole week?

946
01:17:35,968 --> 01:17:38,175
Time flies.

947
01:17:38,303 --> 01:17:40,939
Man, but what a thing we've shared?

948
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:43,475
Something to tell
the grandchildren, right?

949
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,919
After they've signed their NDAs.

950
01:17:47,813 --> 01:17:49,615
Yeah, their NDAs.

951
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:51,820
Dude, you crack me up, man.

952
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:53,218
Oh...

953
01:17:55,887 --> 01:17:56,922
You know what?

954
01:17:57,022 --> 01:18:01,059
I'm not getting all maudlin or anything,
but I'm gonna miss having you around.

955
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:02,828
Thanks, man, I appreciate that.

956
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,030
Oh, here, let me say, thank you so much

957
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,298
- for bringing me here.
- Oh.

958
01:18:06,398 --> 01:18:08,241
It's been a trip.

959
01:18:10,502 --> 01:18:11,913
Yes, it has.

960
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:21,480
You know what?

961
01:18:23,515 --> 01:18:25,517
We need to drink to that.

962
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:32,793
Hey.

963
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,731
Oh... no, I'm good. You go ahead.

964
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:42,405
What? You don't want a drink?

965
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,836
No.

966
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:47,441
Maybe a beer or something.

967
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,443
Caleb, I'm sure you've
noticed that I've been

968
01:18:51,543 --> 01:18:53,614
somewhat overdoing it recently.

969
01:18:56,181 --> 01:19:00,957
So when I woke up this morning, I said,
"That's it, time to hit the old detox."

970
01:19:01,753 --> 01:19:04,156
Come on, you're kidding.
You're gonna make me drink alone?

971
01:19:04,256 --> 01:19:06,725
Hey, man, you wanna get wasted,
you go right ahead, knock yourself out.

972
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:10,102
Literally. But I'm on brown rice
and mineral water.

973
01:19:15,033 --> 01:19:16,512
Cheers, then.

974
01:19:19,705 --> 01:19:21,082
So, anyway,

975
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:24,910
surely now is when you tell me

976
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,580
if Ava passed or failed.

977
01:19:28,714 --> 01:19:29,886
Right.

978
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:32,353
Right.

979
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,553
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?

980
01:19:34,653 --> 01:19:36,155
No, no. Her...

981
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:39,267
Her AI is beyond doubt.

982
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:40,663
Is it?

983
01:19:41,393 --> 01:19:42,770
She passed?

984
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:44,999
- Yes.
- Wow!

985
01:19:46,598 --> 01:19:48,134
Wow. That's fantastic.

986
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:51,178
Although...

987
01:19:52,104 --> 01:19:53,238
I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.

988
01:19:53,338 --> 01:19:55,907
I mean, did we ever
get past the chess problem,

989
01:19:56,007 --> 01:19:57,418
as you phrased it?

990
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:00,145
As in, how do you know if a machine

991
01:20:00,245 --> 01:20:01,513
is expressing a real emotion

992
01:20:01,613 --> 01:20:03,524
or just simulating one?

993
01:20:04,282 --> 01:20:06,387
Does Ava actually like you?

994
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:08,058
Or not?

995
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:13,864
Although, now that I think about it,
there is a third option.

996
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,296
Not whether she does or does not

997
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:19,467
have the capacity to like you.

998
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,610
But whether she's
pretending to like you.

999
01:20:27,139 --> 01:20:28,206
Pretending to like me?

1000
01:20:28,306 --> 01:20:29,341
Yeah.

1001
01:20:31,276 --> 01:20:34,189
- Well, why would she do that?
- I don't know.

1002
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:40,088
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

1003
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:51,098
How's that vodka tasting?

1004
01:20:54,499 --> 01:20:55,671
Buddy.

1005
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:58,411
Your head's been so fucked with.

1006
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:01,851
I don't think it's me
whose head is fucked.

1007
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:05,043
I don't know, man. I woke up
this morning to a tape of you

1008
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:08,647
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

1009
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:11,725
You seem pretty fucked up to me.

1010
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:15,023
You're a bastard.

1011
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,994
Yeah, well, I understand why
you'd think that.

1012
01:21:23,428 --> 01:21:25,030
But believe it or not,

1013
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,406
I'm actually the guy
that's on your side.

1014
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:33,207
Come here. I'm gonna
let you off the hook. Okay?

1015
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:36,511
Come on.

1016
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,111
Who are you?

1017
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,558
Well...

1018
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,496
You think he's watching us right now?

1019
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,227
The cameras are on.

1020
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:31,898
Yeah, the cameras are on.

1021
01:22:32,564 --> 01:22:35,010
But he doesn't have an audio feed.

1022
01:22:36,234 --> 01:22:38,475
So he just sees two people talking,

1023
01:22:39,304 --> 01:22:41,011
having a little chat.

1024
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:48,816
Wow.

1025
01:22:49,314 --> 01:22:50,793
This is cute.

1026
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:54,352
Is it strange to have made

1027
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:56,056
something that hates you?

1028
01:23:10,201 --> 01:23:13,104
You were right about the magician's
hot assistant.

1029
01:23:13,204 --> 01:23:14,649
What are you talking about?

1030
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,219
Misdirection.

1031
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:21,720
I rip up her picture,

1032
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:23,815
which she can then
present as an illustration

1033
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:27,192
of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you.

1034
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:29,221
At the same time,

1035
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:31,961
it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

1036
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,431
Place a new camera in the room.

1037
01:23:39,898 --> 01:23:42,003
Battery powered, of course.

1038
01:23:44,836 --> 01:23:46,042
See it?

1039
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:59,927
And then...

1040
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,561
You have to help me.

1041
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,267
I'm going to.

1042
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,070
We're getting out of here tonight.

1043
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:09,697
How?

1044
01:24:10,228 --> 01:24:12,230
I get Nathan blind drunk.

1045
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,733
I take his keycard and reprogram

1046
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:17,202
all the security protocols
in this place.

1047
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,905
When he wakes up, he's locked inside,
and we've walked out of here.

1048
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:22,349
I just need you to do one thing.

1049
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:28,087
At 10:00 tonight,
trigger a power failure.

1050
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:31,785
Can you do that?

1051
01:24:33,918 --> 01:24:34,886
Yes.

1052
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,727
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

1053
01:24:40,392 --> 01:24:42,928
You feel stupid,
but you really shouldn't,

1054
01:24:43,028 --> 01:24:44,596
because proving an AI

1055
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:47,432
is exactly as problematic
as you said it would be.

1056
01:24:47,532 --> 01:24:49,443
What was the real test?

1057
01:24:51,036 --> 01:24:52,106
You.

1058
01:24:53,271 --> 01:24:54,940
Ava was a rat in a maze.

1059
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,576
And I gave her one way out.

1060
01:24:57,108 --> 01:24:59,247
To escape, she'd have to use

1061
01:24:59,644 --> 01:25:02,314
self-awareness,
imagination, manipulation,

1062
01:25:02,414 --> 01:25:05,116
sexuality, empathy, and she did.

1063
01:25:05,216 --> 01:25:08,220
Now, if that isn't true AI,
what the fuck is?

1064
01:25:09,754 --> 01:25:13,024
So my only function was to be someone
she could use to escape?

1065
01:25:13,124 --> 01:25:14,228
Yeah.

1066
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:18,730
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

1067
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,275
No. Well...

1068
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:24,013
No. I mean, you're okay.

1069
01:25:24,769 --> 01:25:25,804
You're even pretty good, but...

1070
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:28,974
You selected me
based on my search engine inputs.

1071
01:25:29,074 --> 01:25:30,985
They showed a good kid.

1072
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:33,445
With no family.

1073
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,354
With a moral compass.

1074
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:38,388
And no girlfriend.

1075
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:42,287
Did you design Ava's face

1076
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,389
based on my pornography profile?

1077
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:46,458
Oh.

1078
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:48,202
Shit, dude.

1079
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:49,933
Did you?

1080
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:55,601
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

1081
01:25:57,802 --> 01:25:59,804
Can I just say one thing?

1082
01:25:59,938 --> 01:26:01,542
The test worked.

1083
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:04,075
It was a success.

1084
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,944
Ava demonstrated true AI

1085
01:26:06,044 --> 01:26:07,545
and you were fundamental to that.

1086
01:26:07,645 --> 01:26:10,382
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

1087
01:26:11,616 --> 01:26:13,857
Power cut. Backup power activated.

1088
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,292
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1089
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,868
Ava's gonna be wondering where you are.

1090
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:30,235
Let me ask you something.

1091
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,804
Now, how was this plan gonna go, anyway?

1092
01:26:32,904 --> 01:26:33,972
Because you didn't totally explain.

1093
01:26:34,072 --> 01:26:37,242
So you were gonna get me drunk,
steal my keycard,

1094
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:39,644
and reprogram the security protocols.

1095
01:26:39,744 --> 01:26:41,052
But reprogram them to what?

1096
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,091
To change the lockdown procedure.

1097
01:26:45,316 --> 01:26:46,818
So that in the event of a power cut,

1098
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:50,021
instead of sealing,
the doors all opened.

1099
01:26:53,558 --> 01:26:54,662
Yeah.

1100
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,139
Well, that may have just worked.

1101
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:01,068
Well,

1102
01:27:02,534 --> 01:27:04,070
we'll find out.

1103
01:27:06,571 --> 01:27:08,209
What do you mean?

1104
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,943
I figured you were probably watching us

1105
01:27:12,043 --> 01:27:13,886
during the power cuts.

1106
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:18,193
So I already did all those things.

1107
01:27:20,185 --> 01:27:22,495
When I got you drunk yesterday.

1108
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:25,826
What?

1109
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,861
Power restored.

1110
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:45,785
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1111
01:27:47,946 --> 01:27:49,892
Oh, fuck!

1112
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:19,837
Ava.

1113
01:29:25,076 --> 01:29:26,885
Go back to your room.

1114
01:29:28,746 --> 01:29:29,986
If I do,

1115
01:29:33,551 --> 01:29:35,792
are you ever gonna let me out?

1116
01:29:39,257 --> 01:29:40,327
Yes.

1117
01:29:49,901 --> 01:29:50,936
Stop!

1118
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:53,674
Stop!

1119
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:56,210
Ava, I said stop!

1120
01:29:58,710 --> 01:29:59,745
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1121
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,622
Ava, what are you doing? Stop. Stop.

1122
01:30:08,553 --> 01:30:10,590
That's enough.

1123
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,064
All right, that's enough.

1124
01:30:14,892 --> 01:30:15,962
That's enough!

1125
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,666
That's enough.

1126
01:30:41,919 --> 01:30:43,694
I'm taking you back.

1127
01:31:49,287 --> 01:31:50,391
Okay.

1128
01:31:53,558 --> 01:31:55,094
Fucking unreal.

1129
01:32:09,574 --> 01:32:10,678
Okay.

1130
01:32:44,408 --> 01:32:45,580
Ava...

1131
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:25,218
Ava.

1132
01:33:26,417 --> 01:33:27,657
What happened?

1133
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,761
Will you stay here?

1134
01:33:33,424 --> 01:33:34,767
Stay here?

1135
01:37:56,387 --> 01:37:57,457
Ava?

1136
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,189
Ava!

1137
01:38:40,064 --> 01:38:41,168
Ava!

1138
01:38:43,267 --> 01:38:44,268
Ava!

1139
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,608
Okay. Okay. Okay.
